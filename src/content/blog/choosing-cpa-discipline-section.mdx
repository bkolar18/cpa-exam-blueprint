Under CPA Evolution, you must choose one of three discipline sections to complete your CPA license. This decision impacts your study time, pass probability, and potentially your career trajectory. Here's how to make the right choice.

## The Three Discipline Sections

### BAR - Business Analysis & Reporting

**Focus:** Advanced financial accounting, data analytics, and financial statement analysis

**Pass Rate:** 33-40% (lowest of the three)

### TCP - Tax Compliance & Planning

**Focus:** Advanced tax planning, research, and compliance

**Ideal for:**
- Tax career path candidates
- Those who excelled in REG
- Candidates working in tax practice

**Pass Rate:** 72-82% (highest of the three)

### ISC - Information Systems & Controls

**Focus:** IT governance, cybersecurity, data management, and IT controls

**Ideal for:**
- IT audit candidates
- Those interested in systems and technology
- Candidates pursuing advisory/consulting roles

**Pass Rate:** ~51% (middle range)

## Quick Comparison

| Factor | BAR | TCP | ISC |
|--------|-----|-----|-----|
| Pass Rate | 33-40% | 72-82% | ~51% |
| Study Hours | 100-130 | 80-110 | 90-120 |
| FAR Overlap | High | Low | Moderate |
| REG Overlap | Low | High | Low |
| Career Path | Audit/Reporting | Tax | IT/Advisory |
| Difficulty | Hardest | Easiest | Moderate |

## Testing Schedule

All discipline sections follow quarterly testing windows:

| Quarter | Testing Window | Score Release |
|---------|----------------|---------------|
| Q1 | January | February |
| Q2 | April | May |
| Q3 | July | August |
| Q4 | October | November |

**Important:** Unlike core sections with continuous testing, you can only take discipline sections during these windows. Plan accordingly.

## Deep Dive: BAR

### Content Areas

1. **Business Analysis** (40-50%)
   - Financial statement analysis
   - Prospective financial information
   - Ratio analysis and interpretation

2. **Technical Accounting & Reporting** (35-45%)
   - Complex accounting topics
   - SEC reporting
   - International accounting standards

3. **State & Local Government** (10-20%)
   - Government-wide financial statements
   - Fund accounting (advanced)

### Who Should Choose BAR

**Strong candidates for BAR:**
- Scored well on FAR (especially governmental)
- Pursuing Big 4 audit or financial reporting
- Comfortable with complex accounting standards
- Strong analytical skills

**Consider alternatives if:**
- Struggled significantly with FAR
- Found governmental accounting very challenging
- Not planning an audit/reporting career path

### BAR Strategy

Given the low pass rate, BAR requires serious commitment:

1. **Master FAR first** - BAR builds directly on FAR concepts
2. **Focus on data analytics** - New competency area
3. **Don't underestimate governmental** - It carries over from FAR
4. **Allow extra study time** - Plan for 100-130 hours

## Deep Dive: TCP

### Content Areas

1. **Tax Compliance** (35-45%)
   - Individual and entity compliance
   - Multistate taxation
   - International tax provisions

2. **Tax Planning** (55-65%)
   - Entity selection and restructuring
   - Compensation and benefits planning
   - Tax research and communication

### Who Should Choose TCP

**Strong candidates for TCP:**
- Scored well on REG
- Working in or pursuing tax
- Enjoy tax research and planning
- Want highest pass probability

**Consider alternatives if:**
- Struggled significantly with REG
- No interest in tax career
- Prefer audit/advisory work

### TCP Strategy

TCP has the highest pass rate for good reason - significant REG overlap:

1. **Take TCP close to REG** - Maximize content synergy
2. **Focus on planning scenarios** - Beyond compliance
3. **Watch for OBBBA changes** - After July 2026
4. **Standard study time** - 80-110 hours typically sufficient

### Tax Law Timing Alert

If taking TCP after July 1, 2026:

- OBBBA provisions will be incorporated
- Ensure your review materials are updated
- Consider taking both REG and TCP before the cutoff if possible

## Deep Dive: ISC

### Content Areas

1. **Information Systems** (35-45%)
   - IT governance and strategy
   - System development and implementation
   - Data management

2. **Security, Confidentiality & Privacy** (35-45%)
   - Cybersecurity frameworks
   - Privacy regulations
   - Security controls

3. **SOC Engagements** (10-20%)
   - SOC 1, 2, and 3 reports
   - Trust services criteria
   - Control testing

### Who Should Choose ISC

**Strong candidates for ISC:**
- Interest in IT audit or advisory
- Comfortable with technology concepts
- Pursuing Big 4 IT audit or consulting
- Understanding of control frameworks

**Consider alternatives if:**
- Minimal technology background
- Pure financial audit focus
- Not interested in systems/IT

### ISC Strategy

ISC is unique - it tests material not covered in core sections:

1. **Learn new frameworks** - COSO, COBIT, SOC criteria
2. **Understand IT processes** - System development life cycle
3. **Don't rely on core section knowledge** - Limited overlap
4. **Focus on controls** - How they're designed and tested

## Decision Framework

### Step 1: Evaluate Your Career Path

| Career Direction | Recommended Discipline |
|------------------|------------------------|
| Tax (public or private) | TCP |
| Financial audit | BAR or ISC |
| IT audit | ISC |
| Financial reporting | BAR |
| Advisory/Consulting | ISC or BAR |
| General/Undecided | TCP (highest pass rate) |

### Step 2: Consider Your Strengths

| If You Excelled In... | Consider... |
|----------------------|-------------|
| FAR (especially government) | BAR |
| REG (enjoyed tax topics) | TCP |
| Neither strongly | TCP or ISC |
| Technology/systems | ISC |

### Step 3: Assess Time Constraints

| Time Situation | Consider... |
|----------------|-------------|
| Tight 18-month window | TCP (highest pass rate) |
| Plenty of time | Any (choose strategically) |
| Failed a core section | TCP to rebuild momentum |

### Step 4: Check Employer Preferences

Some employers prefer specific disciplines:

- **Big 4 Tax:** Often prefer TCP
- **Big 4 IT Audit:** Often prefer ISC
- **Big 4 Audit:** BAR can differentiate
- **Industry:** Usually no strong preference

Ask your employer or target employers what they value.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Choosing Based Only on Pass Rate

TCP's high pass rate is attractive, but if you:
- Hate tax
- Struggled badly with REG
- Are pursuing IT audit

...TCP may not be your best choice despite the statistics.

### Mistake 2: Ignoring Career Alignment

Your discipline choice can signal career direction. If you're clearly pursuing IT audit, choosing TCP because it's "easier" may raise questions.

### Mistake 3: Not Timing With Core Sections

- **TCP:** Take close to REG for synergy
- **BAR:** Take after FAR while content is fresh
- **ISC:** More flexible timing

### Mistake 4: Underestimating Discipline Difficulty

Discipline sections are:
- Limited testing windows (quarterly)
- Potentially different content than core sections
- Still require dedicated study time

## Changing Your Mind

### Before Registration

You can change your discipline choice before registering for the exam. Simply register for a different section.

### After Registration

Switching after registration typically requires:
- Forfeiting paid fees
- Waiting for the next testing window
- Re-registering for the new section

### After Passing Core Sections

You can still choose any discipline section. Your core sections remain valid within your 18-month window.

## Final Recommendations

### If Unsure, Choose TCP

**Rationale:**
- Highest pass rate (72-82%)
- Strong overlap with REG
- Valuable tax knowledge regardless of career path

### If Pursuing Audit, Consider ISC

**Rationale:**
- IT audit is high-demand specialty
- Differentiates your skill set
- Moderate pass rate (~51%)

### If Strong in FAR and Pursuing Financial Reporting

**Rationale:**
- BAR deepens FAR knowledge
- Signals technical expertise
- Be prepared for lowest pass rate

## Your Next Steps

1. **Reflect on your career goals** - Where do you see yourself?
2. **Assess your core section performance** - What came naturally?
3. **Research employer preferences** - If applicable
4. **Make a decision** - Don't overthink it
5. **Commit to your study plan** - Execute with focus

Remember: All three disciplines lead to the same CPA license. Choose wisely, but don't stress excessively - you can succeed with any of them.
