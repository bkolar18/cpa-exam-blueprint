The Tax Compliance and Planning (TCP) section is one of three discipline sections introduced with CPA Evolution. TCP is an excellent choice for candidates with a tax background or those who enjoy detailed, rules-based content.

## TCP at a Glance

| Metric | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Testing | Continuous (year-round) |
| Duration | 4 hours |
| Questions | 68 MCQs + 7 TBS |
| Difficulty | Moderate |
| Study Hours | 100-120 recommended |

## Why TCP Appeals to Many Candidates

TCP is a popular discipline choice for several reasons:

1. **Self-selection** - Candidates choosing TCP typically have tax experience
2. **Familiar content** - Many topics overlap with REG
3. **Practical application** - Real-world tax scenarios can be easier to grasp
4. **Clear rules** - Tax law, while complex, follows defined rules

## Exam Structure

TCP consists of 5 testlets:

| Testlet | Content | Count |
|---------|---------|-------|
| 1 | Multiple Choice Questions | 34 MCQs |
| 2 | Multiple Choice Questions | 34 MCQs |
| 3 | Task-Based Simulations | 2 TBS |
| 4 | Task-Based Simulations | 2 TBS |
| 5 | Task-Based Simulations | 3 TBS |

**Scoring Breakdown:**
- MCQs: 50% of total score
- TBS: 50% of total score

## Content Areas

### Area 1: Tax Compliance and Planning for Individuals (30-40%)

The largest content area focuses on individual taxation:

- **Filing status and dependents** - Determination rules, phase-outs
- **Gross income** - Recognition, exclusions, timing
- **Deductions** - Above-the-line, itemized, standard
- **Credits** - Child tax credit, education credits, earned income credit
- **Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)** - Calculations, adjustments, preferences
- **Tax planning strategies** - Timing income/deductions, retirement planning

**Pro tip:** Master the Form 1040 flow. Understanding how items flow through the return helps you answer complex questions efficiently.

### Area 2: Entity Tax Compliance (25-35%)

Focus on business entity taxation:

- **C Corporations** - Formation, operations, distributions, liquidation
- **S Corporations** - Eligibility, built-in gains, AAA tracking
- **Partnerships** - Formation, allocations, distributions, basis
- **LLCs** - Check-the-box rules, default classification
- **Consolidated returns** - Eligibility, intercompany transactions

**Pro tip:** Know the key differences between entity types. Questions often require comparing tax treatment across C corps, S corps, and partnerships.

### Area 3: Entity Tax Planning (15-25%)

Strategic tax considerations for businesses:

- **Choice of entity** - Tax implications of different structures
- **Compensation planning** - Reasonable compensation, fringe benefits
- **Retirement plans** - Qualified vs. non-qualified, contribution limits
- **State tax considerations** - Nexus, apportionment, SALT deduction
- **Multi-jurisdictional issues** - Interstate commerce, tax treaties

**Pro tip:** Entity choice questions are high-yield. Be ready to recommend the optimal entity structure based on given facts.

### Area 4: Property Transactions (10-20%)

Tax treatment of property:

- **Basis determination** - Cost, gift, inheritance, like-kind exchange
- **Gain/loss recognition** - Realized vs. recognized, installment sales
- **Section 1231, 1245, 1250** - Depreciation recapture rules
- **Like-kind exchanges** - Qualifying property, boot, basis
- **Involuntary conversions** - Deferral requirements

**Pro tip:** Section 1231 netting is frequently tested. Master the "hotchpot" rules and how they interact with recapture.

## TCP vs. REG: Key Differences

If you've already passed REG, here's what's different in TCP:

| Topic | REG Coverage | TCP Focus |
|-------|--------------|-----------|
| Individual tax | Moderate | Deep dive, complex scenarios |
| Business entities | Basics | Advanced planning, choice of entity |
| Tax planning | Limited | Extensive strategy focus |
| Ethics | Circular 230 | Not tested |
| Business law | Tested | Not tested |

TCP goes deeper on tax topics while dropping the business law and ethics content from REG.

## Time Management Strategy

| Testlet | Time Allocation |
|---------|-----------------|
| Testlet 1 (34 MCQs) | ~55 minutes |
| Testlet 2 (34 MCQs) | ~55 minutes |
| Testlet 3 (2 TBS) | ~30 minutes |
| Testlet 4 (2 TBS) | ~30 minutes |
| Testlet 5 (3 TBS) | ~45 minutes |
| **Total** | **4 hours** |

**MCQ Pacing:** Aim for 1.5 minutes per question.
**TBS Pacing:** Aim for 15 minutes per simulation.

## Study Strategy by Phase

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-3)

Build your tax knowledge base:

1. **Review individual taxation thoroughly** - This is 30-40% of your exam
2. **Create entity comparison charts** - C corp vs. S corp vs. Partnership
3. **Complete 25-30 MCQs per topic** - Focus on understanding, not memorization
4. **Bookmark IRC sections** - Know where to find key rules

### Phase 2: Deep Dive (Weeks 4-6)

Intensify your practice:

1. **Increase MCQ volume** - 50-75 per day
2. **Focus on property transactions** - Basis calculations are TBS favorites
3. **Practice multi-step problems** - TCP TBS often require several calculations
4. **Work through tax return simulations** - Get comfortable with form-based questions

### Phase 3: Review (Weeks 7-8)

Final preparation:

1. **Take 2-3 full practice exams** - Under timed conditions
2. **Focus on weak areas** - Your practice exam results will guide you
3. **Review phase-outs and limits** - These change frequently
4. **Refresh individual tax basics** - Don't let the largest area go stale

## Must-Know Concepts

### Individual Tax Formula

Memorize this flow:

```
Gross Income
- Above-the-Line Deductions
= Adjusted Gross Income (AGI)
- Greater of (Itemized or Standard Deduction)
= Taxable Income
× Tax Rates
= Tax Before Credits
- Credits
= Tax Liability
```

### Entity Comparison Quick Reference

| Feature | C Corp | S Corp | Partnership |
|---------|--------|--------|-------------|
| Taxation | Entity level | Pass-through | Pass-through |
| Basis for losses | N/A | Stock + debt | Capital + share of liabilities |
| Self-employment tax | N/A | No (distributions) | Yes (general partners) |
| Special allocations | No | No | Yes |
| Ownership restrictions | None | 100 shareholders, US only | Flexible |

### Key Phase-Outs to Know

- Child tax credit phase-out thresholds
- Earned income credit thresholds by filing status
- Education credit phase-outs
- Qualified business income (QBI) deduction thresholds

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Overlooking Filing Status Rules

Filing status affects everything. Know:
- Head of household requirements
- Married filing separately limitations
- Qualifying widow(er) rules

### Mistake 2: Confusing Basis Rules

Each entity type has different basis rules:
- Stock basis for S corps (no debt basis to shareholder)
- Inside vs. outside basis for partnerships
- Boot and carryover basis in like-kind exchanges

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Limitations

Many deductions and credits have limits:
- At-risk limitations
- Passive activity loss rules
- Net operating loss carryforward rules

### Mistake 4: Rushing Through TBS

TCP TBS often have multiple exhibits and require careful reading:
- Tax returns to analyze
- Multiple years to compare
- Planning scenarios to evaluate

## Study Resources

- **Publication 334** - Small business tax guide

4. Like-kind exchange calculations
5. Section 1231/1245/1250 character rules
6. Choice of entity analysis
7. Retirement plan contribution limits

## Practical Study Tips

1. **Leverage your REG knowledge.** TCP builds on REG concepts, so use that foundation as a starting point.

2. **Practice with real tax forms.** TBS often simulate practical tax return preparation - familiarity with form layouts helps.

3. **Create flashcards for phase-out limits.** Income limits and phase-outs are frequently tested and worth memorizing.

4. **Master entity choice comparisons.** Know the pros and cons of each business structure - these questions appear regularly.

5. **Stay consistent with your study schedule.** TCP content is learnable with focused, dedicated effort over time.
