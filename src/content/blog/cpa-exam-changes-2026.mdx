The CPA profession is undergoing significant changes in 2026, with new licensure pathways that could reshape how candidates become CPAs. Here's what you need to know.

## The Big Change: New Licensure Pathways

In 2025, AICPA and NASBA approved model legislation creating alternative pathways to CPA licensure. Starting in 2026, qualifying candidates may have **three distinct routes** to becoming a CPA.

### Pathway 1: Traditional (150 Hours)

The familiar route remains available:

- Bachelor's degree with accounting concentration
- 150 semester hours total
- 1 year of professional experience
- Pass all four CPA Exam sections

### Pathway 2: Post-Baccalaureate Degree

A streamlined option for graduate students:

- Post-baccalaureate degree (Master's) with accounting concentration
- 1 year of professional experience
- Pass all four CPA Exam sections

No need to reach 150 total hours if you have a Master's in accounting.

### Pathway 3: Bachelor's + Extended Experience

The most significant new option:

- Bachelor's degree with accounting concentration
- **2 years** of professional experience (instead of 1)
- Pass all four CPA Exam sections

This pathway eliminates the 150-hour requirement for candidates willing to gain an additional year of experience.

## Why This Matters

### Addressing the Talent Pipeline

The accounting profession has faced a well-documented talent shortage. Key factors:

- Declining accounting major enrollments
- Competition from tech and finance sectors
- 150-hour requirement seen as a barrier

These new pathways aim to bring more qualified professionals into the CPA pipeline while maintaining rigorous standards.

### Cost and Time Savings

For candidates choosing Pathway 3:

- **Save 30 credit hours** of additional education
- **Reduce student debt** from graduate coursework
- **Enter workforce sooner** (though with longer experience requirement)

### Trade-Offs to Consider

| Factor | 150-Hour Path | Bachelor's + 2 Years |
|--------|---------------|---------------------|
| Education cost | Higher | Lower |
| Time to license | Similar | Similar |
| Experience required | 1 year | 2 years |
| Graduate credential | Possible | No |
| Starting salary | Varies | Varies |

## State Adoption Status

The new pathways require state-level legislative adoption. As of early 2026:

### States That Have Adopted (14+ states)

States that have enacted legislation or amended rules include:

- Texas (effective August 1, 2026)
- Tennessee (effective January 1, 2026)
- Minnesota (passed May 2025)
- Additional states pending

### States Under Consideration

Many states have legislation pending or are actively reviewing adoption.

### Important Note

Even after AICPA/NASBA approval, **you must check your specific state board** for:

- Adoption status
- Effective dates
- Specific requirements

Don't assume your state has adopted the new pathways without verification.

## Tax Law Changes: OBBBA Impact

Beyond licensure pathways, 2026 brings significant tax law changes affecting the REG and TCP exam sections.

### Timeline

- **Through June 30, 2026:** Old tax provisions (expiring 2025) remain testable
- **Starting July 1, 2026:** OBBBA provisions incorporated into REG and TCP

### Strategic Implications

If you're taking REG or TCP:

**Before July 1, 2026:**
- Study current tax law only
- No need to learn OBBBA provisions yet

**After July 1, 2026:**
- Must learn new OBBBA provisions
- Ensure review materials are updated

**Efficiency Consideration:** If taking both REG and TCP, try to complete both before or after July 1, 2026. Taking REG before and TCP after means studying different tax law versions - inefficient.

## CPA Exam Structure: No Major Changes

The core exam structure remains stable for 2026:

### Core Sections (Continuous Testing)

- **FAR** - Financial Accounting & Reporting
- **AUD** - Auditing & Attestation
- **REG** - Regulation

All three available year-round with scores released every 1-2 weeks.

### Discipline Sections (Quarterly Testing)

Choose ONE:

- **BAR** - Business Analysis & Reporting
- **TCP** - Tax Compliance & Planning
- **ISC** - Information Systems & Controls

Discipline sections tested in the first month of each quarter (January, April, July, October) with quarterly score releases.

### 18-Month Window

Once you pass your first section, you have 18 months to pass all remaining sections. This rolling window continues through 2026.

## 2026 CPA Exam Blueprint

The 2026 blueprint brings minor refinements rather than major changes:

### Skill Levels Remain Consistent

1. Remembering and Understanding
2. Application
3. Analysis
4. Evaluation

### Content Area Weights

Slight adjustments to content area percentages may occur. Always reference the most current AICPA Blueprint.

## Planning Your Strategy for 2026

### If You're Starting in 2026

1. **Check your state's pathway options** - Are new pathways available?
2. **Evaluate your education status** - Which pathway fits your situation?
3. **Consider tax law timing** - Plan REG/TCP around the July 1 cutoff
4. **Build a realistic timeline** - Account for 18-month window

### If You're Already in Progress

1. **Maintain your momentum** - Complete sections you've started
2. **Mind your 18-month clock** - Don't let passed sections expire
3. **Decide on REG/TCP timing** - Before or after July 1, 2026
4. **Stay informed** - Rules may continue evolving

### For Students Still in School

1. **Track state adoption** - Know your options before graduation
2. **Consider your goals** - Graduate degree valuable beyond CPA?
3. **Start early** - Many states allow sitting before 150 hours
4. **Plan experience strategically** - What type of work do you want?

## What Doesn't Change

Despite the new pathways:

- **The CPA Exam itself** remains the same national exam
- **Quality standards** are maintained
- **License reciprocity** continues between states
- **Continuing education** requirements persist post-licensure
- **18-month testing window** still applies

## Common Questions

### Q: Does this make becoming a CPA easier?

Not necessarily. The exam remains the same. The new pathways simply offer different combinations of education and experience. You still must pass all four sections.

### Q: Should I wait for my state to adopt the new pathway?

Depends on your timeline. If you're close to 150 hours, continuing may be faster than waiting for legislative adoption and gaining an extra year of experience.

### Q: Will my license be different based on which pathway I choose?

No. Once licensed, a CPA is a CPA. The credential is the same regardless of pathway.

### Q: How do I know if my state has adopted the new pathways?

Contact your state board of accountancy directly or check their website. Adoption status is changing regularly as more states consider the legislation.

## Stay Informed

The CPA landscape is evolving. To stay current:

1. **Monitor your state board's website**
2. **Follow AICPA and NASBA announcements**
3. **Check your review course for updates**
4. **Join CPA candidate communities** (Reddit r/CPA, etc.)

## Your Next Steps

1. **Determine which pathway applies to you**
2. **Verify your state's adoption status**
3. **Plan your exam timeline accordingly**
4. **Build your personalized study plan**

The fundamentals haven't changed: prepare thoroughly, study consistently, and pass the exam. The new pathways simply offer more flexibility in how you get there.
