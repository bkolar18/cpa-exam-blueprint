The Regulation (REG) section tests federal taxation, business law, and professional ethics. With the highest pass rate among core sections (58-64%), it's often recommended as a confidence-builder - but don't underestimate the volume of content.

| Testing | Continuous (year-round) |
| Duration | 4 hours |
| Questions | 72 MCQs + 8 TBS |
| Pass Rate | 58-64% |
| Study Hours | 80-110 recommended |

## Exam Structure

REG consists of 5 testlets:

| Testlet | Content | Count |

| 2 | Multiple Choice Questions | 36 MCQs |
| 3 | Task-Based Simulations | 2 TBS |

**Scoring Breakdown:**
- MCQs: 50% of total score
- TBS: 50% of total score

## Content Areas

### Area 1: Ethics, Professional Responsibilities & Federal Tax Procedures (10-20%)

Foundational requirements for tax practice:

- **Circular 230** - Treasury regulations for tax practitioners
- **Tax return preparer penalties**
- **IRS audit procedures and appeals**
- **Privilege and confidentiality**
- **Taxpayer rights and responsibilities**

**Pro tip:** Circular 230 is heavily tested. Know the difference between "must," "should," and "may" provisions.

### Area 2: Business Law (10-20%)

Core legal concepts:

- **Contracts** - Formation, performance, breach, remedies
- **Debtor-creditor relationships** - Bankruptcy, secured transactions
- **Agency** - Authority, liability, termination
- **Business structure law** - Partnerships, corporations, LLCs
- **Federal regulations** - Employment law, securities (basic)

**Pro tip:** Business law is conceptual. Focus on understanding principles rather than memorizing specific cases.

### Area 3: Federal Taxation of Property Transactions (12-22%)

How property is taxed:

- **Basis calculations** - Original, adjusted, carryover, stepped-up
- **Gains and losses** - Recognition, characterization, deferral
- **Like-kind exchanges** - Section 1031 requirements
- **Installment sales**
- **Depreciation recapture** - Section 1245, 1250

**Pro tip:** Basis questions appear frequently. Master the formulas for calculating basis in all scenarios.

### Area 4: Federal Taxation of Individuals (15-25%)

Form 1040 and individual tax:

- **Gross income** - What's included, what's excluded
- **Deductions** - Above-the-line, itemized, standard
- **Credits** - Child tax credit, education credits, earned income credit
- **Filing status and exemptions**
- **Alternative minimum tax (AMT)**
- **Self-employment tax**

**Pro tip:** Print a blank Form 1040 and reference it while studying. Visualizing where items go helps retention.

### Area 5: Federal Taxation of Entities (28-38%)

This is the largest content area:

**C Corporations:**
- Formation and basis
- Operating rules
- Distributions and dividends
- Accumulated earnings tax

**S Corporations:**
- Election requirements
- Shareholder basis
- Pass-through taxation
- Built-in gains tax

**Partnerships:**
- Formation and basis
- Partner's distributive share
- Distributions
- Special allocations

**Tax-Exempt Organizations:**
- Qualification requirements
- Unrelated business income
- Private foundations

**Pro tip:** Entity taxation is 28-38% of your exam. Spend proportional study time here, especially on S corps and partnerships.

## 2025-2026 Tax Law Updates

### OBBBA Provisions (Effective July 2026)

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) will be incorporated into REG and TCP starting July 1, 2026:

- Old provisions expiring in 2025 remain testable through June 30, 2026
- New provisions effective 2024-2025 appear on exams starting July 1, 2026

**Strategy:** If you're taking REG before July 2026, you won't need to study OBBBA changes. If taking after, ensure your review materials are updated.

## Time Management Strategy

| Testlet | Time Allocation |
|---------|-----------------|
| Testlet 1 (36 MCQs) | ~48 minutes |
| Testlet 2 (36 MCQs) | ~48 minutes |
| Testlet 3 (2 TBS) | ~36 minutes |
| Testlet 4 (3 TBS) | ~54 minutes |
| Testlet 5 (3 TBS) | ~54 minutes |
| **Total** | **4 hours** |

## Study Strategy by Phase

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-3)

Build tax fundamentals:

1. **Start with individual taxation** - It's most intuitive and builds foundation
2. **Print Form 1040** - Reference it constantly
3. **Learn tax formula flow** - Gross income → AGI → Taxable income → Tax liability
4. **Complete 30-40 MCQs per topic**

### Phase 2: Entity Focus (Weeks 4-6)

Tackle the largest content area:

1. **Master basis calculations** - They appear in every entity type
2. **Create comparison charts** - C corp vs S corp vs Partnership
3. **Focus on formation and liquidation** - High-value topics
4. **Practice entity-specific TBS**

### Phase 3: Business Law & Review (Weeks 7-8)

Round out your knowledge:

1. **Dedicate time to business law** - Don't skip it for more tax
2. **Review Circular 230 thoroughly**
3. **Take full practice exams**
4. **Focus on weak areas identified in practice**

## Must-Know Formulas

### Individual Tax Formula

```
Gross Income
- Adjustments (Above-the-line deductions)
= Adjusted Gross Income (AGI)
- Greater of: Standard Deduction OR Itemized Deductions
= Taxable Income
× Tax Rate
= Tax Liability
- Credits
+ Other Taxes (SE tax, AMT)
= Total Tax
- Payments/Withholding
= Tax Due or Refund
```

### Partnership Basis

```
Initial Basis (cash + FMV of property contributed)
+ Share of income
+ Share of tax-exempt income
+ Increase in share of liabilities
- Distributions received
- Share of losses
- Share of nondeductible expenses
- Decrease in share of liabilities
= Adjusted Basis
```

### S Corporation Shareholder Basis

```
Initial Basis
+ Share of income
+ Share of tax-exempt income
- Distributions
- Share of losses (limited to basis)
- Share of nondeductible expenses
= Adjusted Basis
```

Note: S corp basis does NOT include share of liabilities (unlike partnerships).

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Neglecting Business Law

Business law is 10-20% of the exam. Candidates who skip it lose easy points on conceptual questions.

### Mistake 2: Confusing Entity Rules

S corps, partnerships, and C corps have different rules for:
- Basis calculations
- Loss limitations
- Distribution taxation

Create comparison charts to keep them straight.

### Mistake 3: Not Memorizing Limitations

Know the dollar thresholds:
- Section 179 limits
- Charitable contribution limits by entity type
- NOL carryforward rules
- Passive activity loss limits

### Mistake 4: Ignoring Ethics

Circular 230 questions are straightforward if you've studied. Don't sacrifice free points.

## High-Yield Topics

Based on exam feedback, prioritize:

1. **Basis calculations** (all entity types)
2. **Individual deductions** (itemized vs. standard, limits)
3. **S corporation taxation** (eligibility, basis, AAA)
4. **Partnership distributions** (cash and property)
5. **Like-kind exchanges** (Section 1031)
6. **Depreciation and recapture**
7. **Circular 230** (practitioner responsibilities)
8. **Contract formation and breach**

## Entity Comparison Quick Reference

| Feature | C Corp | S Corp | Partnership |
|---------|--------|--------|-------------|
| Taxation | Entity level | Pass-through | Pass-through |
| Basis includes liabilities | No | No | Yes |
| Max shareholders/partners | Unlimited | 100 | Unlimited |
| Shareholder types | Any | Restricted | Any |
| Distributions taxed | Yes (dividends) | No (up to basis) | No (up to basis) |
| Fiscal year | Flexible | Calendar (usually) | Varies |

## Tips from CPAs Who Passed

1. **"Basis, basis, basis. If you know basis calculations cold, you'll pass."**

2. **"I made flashcards for every tax threshold and limit. They were invaluable."**

3. **"Don't underestimate business law. I almost did and it cost me points."**

4. **"Print Form 1040 and write on it while studying. It helps visualize the flow."**

## REG and TCP Synergy

If you choose TCP (Tax Compliance and Planning) as your discipline section:

- There's significant content overlap with REG
- Consider taking them close together
- TCP goes deeper into planning and compliance

## Ready to Start?

REG rewards methodical study of tax rules and formulas. Master basis calculations, understand entity taxation differences, and don't neglect business law or ethics.

With consistent effort and strategic focus, REG's high pass rate can work in your favor. Build your study plan and get started.
