## TBS Complexity Levels

Based on research from actual CPA exam preparation materials and the AICPA, TBS questions vary in complexity. Our question bank should mirror this distribution.

### Complexity Definitions

| Level | Requirements | Exhibits | Characteristics | Distribution |
|-------|-------------|----------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Simple** | 3-5 | 1-2 | Single concept, straightforward calculations, matching exercises | 40% |
| **Moderate** | 5-7 | 2-3 | Multi-step calculations, journal entries, document review with several items | 45% |
| **Complex** | 7-10 | 3-4 | Comprehensive scenarios, multiple interrelated calculations, extensive document review | 15% |

### Simple TBS Characteristics (3-5 requirements)
- Single accounting concept or tax calculation
- Matching exercises (5-10 items)
- Basic journal entries (1-2 entries)
- Single calculation with 2-3 intermediate steps
- Time estimate: 8-12 minutes

### Moderate TBS Characteristics (5-7 requirements)
- Multi-step calculations requiring intermediate values
- Journal entries with 3-5 lines
- Document review with 4-6 dropdown selections
- Integration of 2-3 related concepts
- Mix of numeric entry and dropdown requirements
- Time estimate: 12-16 minutes

### Complex TBS Characteristics (7-10 requirements)
- Comprehensive scenarios spanning multiple topics
- Multiple interrelated calculations
- Extensive document review (7+ selections)

### Partial Credit Structure
- Each requirement within a TBS is graded independently
- Candidates receive partial credit for correct individual responses
- More complex TBS = more opportunities for partial credit
- Weight requirements appropriately (harder requirements = more points)

## Best Practices for TBS Creation

### General Guidelines
1. **Realistic scenarios** - Use company names, dates, realistic dollar amounts
2. **Multiple exhibits** - Include 2-3 exhibits per TBS (tables, memos, documents)
3. **Time estimates** - 10-18 minutes per TBS is typical
4. **Point allocation** - 4-6 requirements per TBS, varying point weights
5. **Clear instructions** - State exactly what is required

### Numeric Entry Best Practices
- Include tolerance for rounding differences
- Provide relevant tables (PV factors, tax rates)
- Test multi-step calculations
- Include intermediate calculation requirements

### Journal Entry Best Practices
- Include 6-10 account options (including distractors)
- Test both debit and credit entries
- Cover compound entries when appropriate
- Include account descriptions in dropdown

### Document Review Best Practices
- Use realistic document formats (memos, reports)
- Highlight specific areas for review
- Test identification of errors/corrections
- Include multiple dropdown selections per document

### Research Best Practices
- Provide clear scenario context
- Accept alternative valid citations
- Test current authoritative literature
