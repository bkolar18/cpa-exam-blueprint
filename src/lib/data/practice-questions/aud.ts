        D: 'Providing advice on accounting matters',
      },
      correctAnswer: 'B',
      explanation: 'Making management decisions or performing management functions for an audit client impairs independence. Tax services, agreed-upon procedures, and accounting advice generally do not impair independence when performed properly.',
      tip: 'Management decisions = independence impaired. Advisory services = usually OK.',

        B: 'Professional judgment about users\' needs',
        C: 'A fixed percentage of total assets',
        D: 'Management\'s assessment of risk',
      },
      correctAnswer: 'B',
      explanation: 'Materiality is based on the auditor\'s professional judgment about the needs of financial statement users. While benchmarks (like a percentage of revenue or assets) may be used, the determination requires judgment about what would influence users\' decisions.',

    // Risk Assessment
    {
      id: 'aud-005',
      section: 'AUD',
      topic: 'Risk Assessment',
      difficulty: 'medium',
      question: 'Inherent risk is defined as:',
      options: {
        A: 'The risk that audit procedures will not detect a misstatement',
        B: 'The risk that controls will not prevent or detect a misstatement',
        C: 'The risk of misstatement before considering internal control',
        D: 'The risk of issuing an inappropriate audit opinion',
      },
      correctAnswer: 'C',
      explanation: 'Inherent risk is the susceptibility of an assertion to a misstatement that could be material, before considering internal control. It relates to the nature of the account or transaction itself.',
      tip: 'Audit Risk = Inherent Risk x Control Risk x Detection Risk. The auditor can only control Detection Risk.',

        C: 'Control risk is assessed at high',
        D: 'Detection risk is assessed at high',
      },
      correctAnswer: 'C',
      explanation: 'When control risk is high (controls are weak), the auditor must decrease detection risk by performing more substantive testing. There\'s an inverse relationship between control risk and the required substantive testing.',

      },
      correctAnswer: 'C',

        C: 'External confirmations',
        D: 'Analytical procedures',
      },
      correctAnswer: 'C',
      explanation: 'External confirmations (evidence from independent third parties) are generally more reliable than internal evidence. External evidence is harder to manipulate and provides independent corroboration.',

        B: 'Existence/Occurrence',
        C: 'Valuation',
        D: 'Classification',
      },
      correctAnswer: 'A',
      explanation: 'Tracing from source documents (shipping documents) to accounting records tests completeness - ensuring all transactions that should be recorded are recorded. Vouching from records to documents tests existence/occurrence.',
      tip: 'Trace forward = Completeness. Vouch backward = Existence.',
    },
    // Audit Sampling
    {
      id: 'aud-011',
      section: 'AUD',

        C: 'Detection risk',
        D: 'Sampling risk',
      },
      correctAnswer: 'B',
      explanation: 'Risk of incorrect acceptance (for tests of controls) is the risk of concluding controls are effective when they are not. This is the more dangerous sampling risk because it affects audit effectiveness.',
    },
    {
      id: 'aud-012',
      section: 'AUD',
      topic: 'Audit Sampling',
      difficulty: 'hard',

        C: 'Remains the same',
        D: 'Cannot be determined',
      },
      correctAnswer: 'B',
      explanation: 'There is an inverse relationship between tolerable misstatement and sample size. When the auditor can tolerate more misstatement, a smaller sample is needed to provide reasonable assurance. Lower tolerable misstatement requires larger samples.',

      },

        D: 'Management refuses to provide a representation letter',
      },
      correctAnswer: 'B',
      explanation: 'A qualified opinion is issued when there is a material misstatement or inability to obtain evidence that is material but not pervasive. If the issue is material and pervasive, an adverse opinion (misstatement) or disclaimer (scope limitation) is appropriate.',
      tip: 'Material only = Qualified. Material and Pervasive = Adverse (misstatement) or Disclaimer (scope limitation).',
    },

        D: 'Absolute assurance',
      },
      correctAnswer: 'B',
      explanation: 'A review engagement provides limited (negative) assurance - the accountant is not aware of any material modifications needed. Audits provide reasonable (positive) assurance. Compilations provide no assurance.',
      tip: 'Audit = Reasonable assurance. Review = Limited assurance. Compilation = No assurance.',
