    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "INTEGRITY requires CPAs to be HONEST and CANDID within client confidentiality constraints. It's the CORE ethical principle—service and public trust must NEVER be subordinated to personal gain. The six AICPA principles: (1) Responsibilities, (2) Public Interest, (3) Integrity, (4) Objectivity/Independence, (5) Due Care, (6) Scope/Nature of Services. Why others fail: (A) Objectivity = IMPARTIALITY and freedom from conflicts—not specifically about honesty; (C) Due care = COMPETENCE and diligence in performing services; (D) Public interest = Acting for collective well-being—broader than personal honesty. Key: Integrity addresses CHARACTER (honest/candid), while objectivity addresses BIAS (impartial/unbiased).",
    "tip": "INTEGRITY = Honest + Candid (character). OBJECTIVITY = Impartial + Unbiased (judgment). DUE CARE = Competent + Diligent (performance).",

    "explanation": "INDEPENDENCE IN APPEARANCE = Avoiding circumstances that would cause a REASONABLE, INFORMED THIRD PARTY to conclude independence is compromised. It's about PERCEPTION—what it LOOKS like to outsiders. Both types required: IN FACT (actual objectivity) + IN APPEARANCE (perceived objectivity). Why others fail: (B) Management override relates to internal control, not independence definition; (C) Partner rotation is a SAFEGUARD to maintain independence, not its definition; (D) This describes INDEPENDENCE IN FACT—the actual state of mind. Critical distinction: You can BE independent (in fact) but not LOOK independent (appearance)—both are required. Example: Owning $10 of client stock may not affect judgment (fact), but creates appearance problem.",

    "explanation": "DIRECT financial interest in an audit client ALWAYS impairs independence—NO MATERIALITY EXCEPTION. Even owning ONE share of client stock = independence impaired. DIRECT = You own it directly (stocks, bonds, notes). INDIRECT = Owned through intermediary (mutual funds, 401k). The critical rule: DIRECT = Always impairs (any amount). INDIRECT = Only impairs if MATERIAL to the CPA. Why others fail: (B) Disclosure doesn't cure direct ownership—must DISPOSE of interest; (C) NO immaterial exception for direct interests—that only applies to indirect; (D) This IS direct (personal ownership), not indirect. Examples: Direct = Own stock personally. Indirect = Own mutual fund that happens to hold client stock.",

An audit manager ON the engagement team = clearly covered. Why others fail: (B) Receptionist has no influence over audit—not covered; (C) Consultant in different office with NO involvement—not covered; (D) Tax partner with NO involvement and not in principal office—not covered (but would be if provided 10+ hours non-attest).

Examples of management functions: Authorizing transactions, hiring/firing employees, directing operations, accepting responsibility for management duties. The principle: Auditor CANNOT audit their own decisions. Why others are acceptable: (B) RECOMMENDATIONS on controls = OK (management decides whether to implement); (C) Valuations can be OK if immaterial or management takes responsibility; (D) Tax returns = Permitted non-attest service with safeguards.

Requirements: Normal lending procedures, terms, requirements. A home mortgage under normal terms = PERMITTED. Why others impair: (A) Unsecured loans = NOT on permitted list; (C) Student loan AFTER becoming covered member = New loans prohibited (existing grandfathered only); (D) Below-market rate = NOT normal terms (preferential treatment). Key: Loans must be (1) on the permitted list AND (2) obtained under NORMAL terms—no special treatment.",

Why others fail: (A) Engagement letter signing may occur AFTER being engaged verbally—period already started; (C) Fieldwork is late—period starts before fieldwork begins; (D) Report issuance = END of period, not beginning.

A valid subpoena = CPA MUST comply—it's a court order. Why others require consent: (A) Business associate consulting = Need client consent; (B) Helping investors = NOT an exception—need consent; (C) Reference for other CPA = Need consent (successor auditor communications).

Critical: Due care is about EFFORT and PROCESS, not guaranteeing results. Why others fail: (A) NO guarantee of accuracy—audits provide reasonable assurance, not guarantees; (C) Insurance is prudent but not an ethical requirement of due care; (D) Delegation is PERMITTED with proper supervision—due care requires oversight, not personal performance of everything.

IRS representation = PERMITTED because outcome uncertain and fee motivates best effort for client. Why others prohibited: (A) Review = Attest service requiring independence; (C) Original tax return = Fee shouldn't depend on refund amount (creates bias to be aggressive); (D) Audit = Cannot have financial interest in outcome.
