    "correctAnswer": "B",

      "D": "The state of mind that permits an unbiased conclusion"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Independence in appearance means avoiding circumstances that would cause a reasonable and informed third party, aware of relevant information, to reasonably conclude that a firm's or member's integrity, objectivity, or professional skepticism is compromised. Independence in fact is the actual state of mind permitting unbiased conclusions.",

    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "A direct financial interest in an audit client always impairs independence, regardless of materiality. Direct ownership of shares is a direct financial interest. Indirect financial interests (through mutual funds, etc.) impair independence only if material to the CPA. There is no 'immaterial' exception for direct interests.",

      "D": "Preparing tax returns"

    "correctAnswer": "A",

The mortgage must have been obtained under normal terms. Unsecured loans and below-market rates impair independence.",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "CPAs may not advertise in a manner that is false, misleading, or deceptive. Guaranteeing specific outcomes or using superlatives that cannot be substantiated violates these rules. Factual claims (largest firm if true, years of experience, free consultation offers) are acceptable if accurate.",

    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "The AICPA permits non-CPA owners if: they actively participate in the firm's business, CPAs remain responsible for all attest and compilation services, and certain state-specific requirements are met (often majority CPA ownership). This allows professionals like attorneys or consultants to have ownership stakes.",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Under AICPA rules, independence is impaired if fees for professional services provided more than one year prior to the current report date remain unpaid when the report is issued.
