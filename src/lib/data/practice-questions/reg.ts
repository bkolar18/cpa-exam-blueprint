    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Per IRC §61(a), gross income means 'all income from whatever source derived' unless specifically excluded. This includes wages, interest, dividends, rents, royalties, alimony (pre-2019), business income, capital gains, and virtually any accession to wealth. The Code then provides specific exclusions in §§101-139. Why other answers are wrong: (B) W-2 only—ignores self-employment, investment income, etc.; (C) Earned income only—passive and investment income are also taxable; (D) Wages/salaries only—misses all non-employment income.",

    "explanation": "Per IRC §1(a), Qualifying Surviving Spouse (QSS) uses the same rate brackets as Married Filing Jointly for two years following the year of spouse's death, if the taxpayer maintains a home for a dependent child (§2(a)). The rate favorability order from best to worst is: MFJ/QSS > Head of Household (§1(b)) > Single (§1(c)) > Married Filing Separately (§1(d)). Why other answers are wrong: (B) Single—rates are higher than QSS and HOH; (C) MFS—typically worst rates plus loses many benefits; (D) HOH—favorable but not as good as QSS/MFJ rates.",

Itemizing only benefits the taxpayer when total itemized deductions exceed the standard deduction amount. Why other answers are wrong: (A) Charitable contributions—itemizing for small charity donations may not exceed standard deduction; (B) Home ownership—mortgage interest alone may not exceed standard deduction post-TCJA; (C) AGI threshold—no such rule; itemizing depends on deduction amounts, not AGI.",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Per IRC §62, deductions 'for AGI' (above-the-line) reduce AGI directly. This matters because many tax benefits phase out at higher AGI levels (e.g., IRA deductions §219, student loan interest §221, education credits §25A). Above-the-line deductions are available whether you itemize or take the standard deduction. Why other answers are wrong: (B) High-income only—above-line deductions (educator expenses, HSA, etc.) are available to all taxpayers; (C) No receipts—documentation is still required; (D) No limits—many have caps (e.g., student loan interest limited to $2,500).",

These rates are significantly lower than ordinary income rates (up to 37%). An additional 3.8% NIIT may apply under §1411 for high earners.

    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Under the IRC, credits directly reduce tax liability dollar-for-dollar, while deductions only reduce taxable income. A $1,000 credit saves $1,000 in tax. A $1,000 deduction saves taxes based on marginal rate (e.g., 22% bracket × $1,000 = $220 tax savings). Credits are defined throughout the Code (§§21-54); deductions in §§62-199A. Why other answers are wrong: (A) Indefinite carryforward—varies by credit type, not a universal feature; (C) No phase-outs—many credits DO phase out (e.g., Child Tax Credit §24(b)); (D) 50% AGI limit—only certain charitable deductions have AGI limits, not all deductions.",

Writing is NOT required UNLESS the Statute of Frauds applies (land sales, contracts >1 year, surety, UCC goods ≥$500).

Chapter 11 preserves jobs, maintains going-concern value, and maximizes creditor recovery compared to liquidation. Why other answers are wrong: (B) Personal debt adjustment only—that's Chapter 13; Ch. 11 is primarily for businesses; (C) Municipal debt—that's Chapter 9, specifically for municipalities; (D) Only liquidation—that's Chapter 7; Ch. 11 is reorganization to continue operating.",
