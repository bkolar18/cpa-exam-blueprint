      correctAnswer: 'C',
      explanation: 'ASC 842 requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability for all leases with a term greater than 12 months, regardless of whether classified as finance or operating. Short-term leases (12 months or less) have an optional exemption.',

      },
      correctAnswer: 'C',
      explanation: 'The criterion is lease term for 75% or more (not 50%) of the remaining economic life. The other options correctly state finance lease criteria: ownership transfer, bargain purchase option, and present value >= 90% of fair value.',

        D: '$43,000',
      },
      correctAnswer: 'B',
      explanation: 'Under ASC 330 (simplified method), inventory is valued at the lower of cost ($50,000) or net realizable value ($48,000). Since NRV is lower, inventory is reported at $48,000.',

        D: '$20,000',
      },
      correctAnswer: 'D',
      explanation: 'Double-declining balance rate = 2 x (1/10) = 20%. Year 1 depreciation = $100,000 x 20% = $20,000. Note: DDB ignores salvage value in the calculation (though depreciation stops when book value equals salvage value).',
      tip: 'DDB rate = 2/useful life. Apply to book value, ignore salvage in calculation.',

      },
      correctAnswer: 'B',
      explanation: 'Issue price = $1,000,000 x 1.02 = $1,020,000. Interest expense = Carrying value x Market rate = $1,020,000 x 5.6% = $57,120. The cash payment would be $60,000 (face x stated rate), with the $2,880 difference reducing the premium.',
