    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "The two fundamental qualitative characteristics are relevance and faithful representation. Comparability, timeliness, verifiability, and understandability are enhancing qualitative characteristics that improve the usefulness of information that is relevant and faithfully represented. Materiality is a component of relevance, and cost-benefit is a pervasive constraint.",

The other characteristics listed are either components of relevance or enhancing characteristics.",

Information can have predictive value without being a prediction itself. Comparability, verifiability, and timeliness are enhancing characteristics.

    "explanation": "Neutrality is a component of faithful representation, which is a fundamental qualitative characteristic, not an enhancing one. The four enhancing qualitative characteristics are comparability, verifiability, timeliness, and understandability. These characteristics enhance the usefulness of information that is already relevant and faithfully represented.",

    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Consistency refers to using the same methods for the same items, either from period to period within a reporting entity or in a single period across entities. Consistency helps achieve the goal of comparability. Comparability is the broader goal that allows users to identify similarities and differences between sets of economic phenomena. Both are considered enhancing characteristics.",

    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Under the current FASB Conceptual Framework (SFAC No. 8, Chapter 4), an asset is defined as 'a present right of an entity to an economic benefit.' This updated definition focuses on the 'right' rather than the 'resource' itself. Option D reflects the older IASB definition. Options B and C are incorrect as they impose unnecessary restrictions on the definition.",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Under SFAC No. 8, a liability is defined as 'a present obligation of an entity to transfer an economic benefit.' The obligation does not need to be legally enforceable; it can arise from customary business practices or a desire to maintain good business relationships. The timing of settlement (one year) is a classification issue, not a definitional one.",
