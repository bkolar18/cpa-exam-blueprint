      "C": "The sum of the personal exemption and standard deduction",
      "D": "$1,000"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Per IRC §6012, a single taxpayer under age 65 must file when gross income equals or exceeds the standard deduction amount ($14,600 for 2024, $15,000 for 2025). The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) suspended personal exemptions through 2025 under IRC §151(d)(5), so the filing threshold is now simply the standard deduction. Why other answers are wrong: (A) Personal exemptions are suspended through 2025 and are not part of the current filing threshold; (C) This was the pre-TCJA rule when personal exemptions existed; (D) The $1,000 threshold is far below the standard deduction and would require filing for nearly everyone.",

      "C": "The standard deduction amount",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Per IRC §6017, a taxpayer must file a return if net self-employment earnings are $400 or more, regardless of total gross income. This lower threshold ensures self-employment tax under IRC §1401 (12.4% Social Security + 2.9% Medicare) is calculated and paid on all qualifying SE income. Why other answers are wrong: (B) $600 is the reporting threshold for Form 1099-NEC, not the SE filing threshold; (C) The standard deduction applies to regular filing requirements, but SE income has its own $400 threshold; (D) $100 is too low - the threshold has been $400 since 1965.",

    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Per IRC §219(b), IRA contribution limits ($7,000 for 2024, $8,000 if 50+) are the same regardless of filing status. Filing status only affects the deduction phase-out thresholds for traditional IRAs. MFS has numerous tax disadvantages under various IRC sections, but contribution limits are not among them. Why other answers are wrong: (B) Correct statement - MFS has lower/zero phase-out thresholds for student loan interest (IRC §221), traditional IRA deductions, and many credits; (C) Correct statement - IRC §32(d) completely disallows EIC for MFS filers; (D) Correct statement - IRC §24(b) provides reduced CTC for MFS filers with phase-outs starting at $200,000 instead of $400,000.",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Per IRC §6072(a), individual income tax returns for calendar-year taxpayers are due on the 15th day of the fourth month following the close of the tax year (April 15). If April 15 falls on a weekend or legal holiday, the due date moves to the next business day per IRC §7503. Form 4868 provides an automatic 6-month extension to October 15. Why other answers are wrong: (A) April 30 is not a standard tax deadline for individuals; (B) June 15 is the automatic extension for U.S. citizens abroad, not the regular due date; (C) March 15 is the due date for S corporations and partnerships, not individuals.",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Per IRC §6081(a), Form 4868 provides an automatic 6-month extension of time to FILE, but IRC §6151 still requires payment by the original due date (April 15). Interest under IRC §6601 and failure-to-pay penalties under IRC §6651(a)(2) accrue on any unpaid balance from the original due date. Why other answers are wrong: (A) This is a common misconception - the extension only extends filing time, not payment time; (C) Form 4868 provides an AUTOMATIC extension with no IRS approval required; (D) Any taxpayer can request an extension regardless of whether they expect a refund or balance due.",

The periods are not evenly spaced - Q3 covers June-August but payment isn't due until September 15, providing extra time during summer. Why other answers are wrong: (B) January 15 is the Q4 payment date for income earned September-December; (C) April 15 is the Q1 payment date for income earned January-March; (D) June 15 is the Q2 payment date for income earned April-May.",

With AGI of $180,000, the higher 110% threshold applies. The alternative safe harbor is 90% of current year tax under IRC §6654(d)(1)(B). Why other answers are wrong: (A) 90% of CURRENT year tax is a safe harbor, but the question asks about prior year tax; (B) 100% of prior year tax is the safe harbor for AGI ≤$150,000, not applicable here; (D) 120% is not a threshold used in estimated tax calculations.",

    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Per IRC §3402(f)(2) and the redesigned Form W-4 (effective 2020 per TCJA implementation), withholding is now based on filing status, income from multiple jobs, dependents, and other adjustments rather than the old allowance system. Employees only need to submit a new W-4 when circumstances change - not annually. Why other answers are wrong: (B) No annual requirement exists - employees only submit new W-4s when life circumstances change; (C) The allowance system was eliminated starting in 2020; (D) Same as C - withholding allowances were replaced with the new factor-based system.",

    "explanation": "Per IRC §6651(a)(1), the failure to file penalty is 5% of the unpaid tax for each month (or part of month) the return is late, up to a maximum of 25%. If the return is over 60 days late, the minimum penalty is the lesser of $510 (2024) or 100% of the tax due. Why other answers are wrong: (A) 10% per month would reach the 25% cap in only 2.5 months - the actual rate is 5%; (B) There is no flat $500 penalty for failure to file; (C) 0.5% per month is the failure to PAY penalty under IRC §6651(a)(2), not failure to FILE.",

A substantial understatement exists under IRC §6662(d)(1)(A) when the understatement exceeds the greater of 10% of the correct tax or $5,000. Why other answers are wrong: (A) 75% is the civil FRAUD penalty under IRC §6663, not the accuracy-related penalty; (B) 10% is not a penalty rate - it's the threshold for defining substantial understatement; (D) 50% is not used in accuracy penalty calculations.",

    "explanation": "Per IRC §6501(a), the IRS must assess tax within 3 years after the return was filed. Under IRC §6501(b)(1), an early-filed return is treated as filed on the due date, so the period runs from the later of filing date or due date. Extended periods apply for substantial omissions (6 years per §6501(e)) and fraud (unlimited per §6501(c)(1)). Why other answers are wrong: (A) 7 years is not a standard assessment period in the IRC; (B) 2 years is the refund claim period from payment date, not the assessment period; (D) 5 years is not a general assessment period.",

    "explanation": "Per IRC §6501(e)(1)(A), the assessment period extends to 6 years when the taxpayer omits gross income exceeding 25% of the amount stated on the return. Example: If reported gross income is $100,000 and actual was $130,000, the $30,000 omission (30%) triggers the 6-year rule. Per IRC §6501(e)(1)(B)(ii), this also applies to substantial overstatements of basis. Why other answers are wrong: (A) EIC claims have no effect on the assessment period; (B) Electronic vs. paper filing has no effect on SOL; (C) Filing an extension affects the due date but not the assessment period duration.",

Under IRC §6511(b)(2), if the claim is filed after 3 years, the refund is limited to amounts paid within the 2 years before the claim. Why other answers are wrong: (A) 4 years is not a valid refund period under the IRC; (B) While 2 years from payment is one option, the statute allows the LATER of this or 3 years from filing; (D) The period runs from filing date, not original due date, and the 2-year payment rule is an alternative.",
