      "D": "$1,000"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "For single taxpayers under 65, the filing threshold is generally equal to the standard deduction amount. Since personal exemptions were suspended by the TCJA (2018-2025), the filing threshold is now just the standard deduction. For 2024, this is $14,600 for single filers under 65.",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "A taxpayer must file a federal income tax return if net self-employment income is $400 or more, regardless of other income or the filing threshold. This lower threshold ensures self-employment tax is paid on all qualifying self-employment income.",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "IRA contribution limits are the same regardless of filing status (though deduction limits may differ). However, married filing separately results in loss of earned income credit, reduced eligibility for child tax credit, lower phase-out thresholds, and inability to deduct student loan interest.",

      "C": "Requires approval from the IRS",
      "D": "Is only available to taxpayers expecting a refund"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Form 4868 provides an automatic 6-month extension of time to FILE (no approval needed), but it does NOT extend the time to PAY. Taxes owed are still due by April 15, and interest and penalties accrue on any unpaid balance from that date.",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Estimated tax payments are due April 15, June 15, September 15, and January 15 of the following year. Note the uneven spacing - the third quarter payment is September 15, not August 15. This gives taxpayers extra time for the summer period.",

      "D": "A flat $500 penalty"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "The failure to file penalty is 5% of unpaid tax for each month (or part of month) the return is late, up to a maximum of 25%.
