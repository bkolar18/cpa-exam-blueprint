      "D": "Authentication is for users; authorization is for systems"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Authentication answers 'Who are you?' by verifying identity (passwords, biometrics, tokens). Authorization answers 'What can you do?' by determining access rights and permissions after identity is confirmed.",

      "D": "No one—it manages itself"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "In SaaS, the cloud provider manages everything—infrastructure, platform, and application. Customers simply use the software (e.g., Gmail, Salesforce). This differs from IaaS (customer manages more) and PaaS (customer manages applications).",
    "tip": "SaaS = provider manages all. PaaS = you manage apps. IaaS = you manage almost everything.",

    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Type 1 reports describe controls at a point in time and evaluate design. Type 2 reports test whether controls operated effectively over a period (typically 6-12 months). Type 2 provides more assurance.",

      "D": "Risk transfer"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Risk transfer shifts the financial impact of a risk to another party, typically through insurance or contracts. Risk avoidance eliminates the risk. Risk mitigation reduces likelihood/impact. Risk acceptance acknowledges the risk without action.",

    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "RTO is the maximum acceptable downtime—how quickly systems must be restored. RPO (Recovery Point Objective) is the maximum acceptable data loss—how much data you can afford to lose (determines backup frequency).",

      "C": "Computer operators cannot modify program code",
      "D": "Database administrators can process transactions"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Proper IT segregation of duties ensures computer operators cannot modify programs, programmers cannot access production data, and DBAs are separated from transaction processing. This prevents unauthorized changes and reduces fraud risk.",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Strong password policies include minimum length (12+ characters), complexity requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters), and reasonable expiration periods. While too-frequent changes can lead to weak passwords, periodic rotation (90 days) balances security and usability.",
    "tip": "Longer passwords + complexity + reasonable rotation = strong policy. Too frequent changes reduce security.",

    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "The change management process begins with submitting a formal change request that documents what will be changed and why. This request is then reviewed, approved, tested, and finally implemented. Skipping the request step bypasses important oversight.",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "User access should be reviewed periodically—typically quarterly for high-risk systems and annually for others. This ensures access rights remain appropriate as job duties change and identifies orphaned accounts. Waiting for termination or audit requests is insufficient.",
