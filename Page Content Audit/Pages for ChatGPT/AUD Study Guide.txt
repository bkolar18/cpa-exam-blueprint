Content Areas
Area 1: Ethics, Professional Responsibilities & General Principles (15-25%)
This foundational area covers:

AICPA Code of Professional Conduct - Independence, integrity, objectivity
Ethics violations and disciplinary actions
Quality control standards - SQCS requirements
Terms of engagement - Engagement letters, pre-engagement activities
Pro tip: Memorize the AICPA's conceptual framework for independence. Questions often present gray-area scenarios requiring judgment.

Area 2: Assessing Risk and Developing a Planned Response (20-30%)
The planning phase of an audit:

Understanding the entity and its environment
Risk assessment procedures - Inquiry, observation, inspection
Assessing risks of material misstatement
Internal control evaluation
Developing the audit strategy and plan
Pro tip: Understand the relationship between assessed risk and the nature, timing, and extent of audit procedures.

Area 3: Performing Procedures and Obtaining Evidence (30-40%)
This is the largest and most heavily tested area:

Audit evidence - Types, sufficiency, appropriateness
Substantive procedures - Tests of details, analytical procedures
Sampling methods - Statistical and non-statistical
Specific account testing - Revenue, inventory, receivables, payables
Audit documentation - Workpaper requirements
Pro tip: Area 3 represents up to 40% of your exam. Spend significant time here mastering sampling concepts and substantive procedure design.

Area 4: Forming Conclusions and Reporting (15-25%)
Wrapping up the audit:

Evaluating audit findings
Audit reports - Unmodified, modified, adverse, disclaimer
Report modifications - Emphasis-of-matter, other-matter paragraphs
Subsequent events and discoveries
Management representations
Pro tip: Memorize the standard audit opinion letter word-for-word. Many questions test your knowledge of specific language and modifications.

Unique Skill: Evaluation
AUD is the only CPA exam section testing the "Evaluation" skill level. This highest-level skill requires you to:

Make professional judgments
Draw conclusions from complex scenarios
Assess appropriateness of audit responses
Expect MCQs and TBS that don't have a single "right" answer but require professional judgment.

Time Management Strategy
Testlet	Time Allocation
Testlet 1 (39 MCQs)	~52 minutes
Testlet 2 (39 MCQs)	~52 minutes
Testlet 3 (2 TBS)	~36 minutes
Testlet 4 (3 TBS)	~54 minutes
Testlet 5 (3 TBS)	~54 minutes
Total	4 hours
MCQ Pacing: Aim for 1.3 minutes per question. TBS Pacing: Aim for 18 minutes per simulation.

Study Strategy by Phase
Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-3)
Build your conceptual understanding:

Focus on audit process flow - Pre-engagement → Planning → Fieldwork → Completion → Reporting
Learn the "why" behind procedures - Understanding purpose helps you answer judgment questions
Complete MCQs after each topic - 25-30 per study session
Create a glossary of audit terms - AUD uses very specific terminology
Phase 2: Deep Dive (Weeks 4-7)
Intensify your practice:

Increase MCQ volume - 50-75 per day
Start TBS practice by week 5 - Don't wait until the end
Focus heavily on Area 3 - Audit evidence and procedures
Memorize the audit opinion letter - Every word matters
Phase 3: Review (Weeks 8-10)
Final preparation:

Take 2-3 full practice exams - Under timed conditions
Review all wrong answers - Create a "missed concepts" list
Light touch on all areas - Don't let any topic go stale
Final ethics review - High-yield for exam day
Must-Know Concepts
Audit Evidence Quality
Appropriateness = Relevance + Reliability

Relevance: Does it relate to the assertion being tested?

Reliability Hierarchy (most to least reliable):

Evidence from independent external sources
Evidence obtained directly by the auditor
Evidence from internal sources with effective controls
Evidence from internal sources with weak controls
Audit Assertions
Memorize assertions for each financial statement category:

Transactions/Events:

Occurrence
Completeness
Accuracy
Cutoff
Classification
Account Balances:

Existence
Rights and obligations
Completeness
Valuation and allocation
Presentation/Disclosure:

Occurrence/Rights
Completeness
Classification/Understandability
Accuracy/Valuation
Modified Opinions
Opinion Type	When Used
Qualified	Material but not pervasive misstatement or scope limitation
Adverse	Material AND pervasive misstatement
Disclaimer	Material AND pervasive scope limitation
Common Mistakes to Avoid
Mistake 1: Memorizing Without Understanding
AUD tests judgment, not just recall. You must understand:

Why a procedure is appropriate for a given risk
How assertions relate to audit procedures
When to modify an audit opinion
Mistake 2: Rushing Through MCQs
AUD MCQs are conceptually dense. Read each question carefully:

Identify what's being asked
Note all relevant facts
Eliminate wrong answers systematically
Mistake 3: Skipping Simulation Practice
TBS are worth 50% of your score. Many candidates:

Practice only MCQs until the last week
Don't learn to navigate the exam interface
Run out of time on complex simulations
Mistake 4: Ignoring SSARS and SSAEs
While auditing is the focus, also know:

Review engagements
Compilation engagements
Attestation standards
Agreed-upon procedures
Study Resources
Free AICPA Materials
AICPA Blueprints - Written by the exam authors
Sample Tests - Official practice questions
Professional Standards - AU-C, AR-C, AT-C sections
High-Yield Topics for Final Review
Audit report modifications and language
Sampling (statistical and non-statistical)
Internal control evaluation
Substantive analytical procedures
Related party transactions
Subsequent events
Going concern evaluation
Tips from CPAs Who Passed
"I read the standard audit opinion letter 50+ times. Questions test specific phrases."

"Don't skip the ethics questions - they're free points if you know the independence rules."

"Area 3 was massive. I spent almost half my study time there."

"Practice TBS early. They require different skills than MCQs."

"Understand the audit process flow. It helps you see how everything connects."

AUD and FAR Synergy
There's significant overlap between FAR and AUD:

Financial statement knowledge helps with account-specific audit procedures
Understanding GAAP helps evaluate misstatements
Consider taking FAR and AUD close together to capitalize on this overlap.

Ready to Start?
AUD rewards candidates who understand the audit process conceptually, not just procedurally. Focus on the "why" behind each procedure, master the standard audit report, and practice applying professional judgment.

Build your study plan, commit to consistent practice, and you'll be ready for exam day.
