Why Candidates Fail TCP
Based on our experience as CPAs, here are the most common reasons candidates struggle:

Treating TCP like another version of REG - this section emphasizes planning over compliance
Not understanding the practical application of tax concepts to client scenarios
Ignoring retirement plan rules - these are heavily tested and require detailed knowledge
Failing to consider multiple tax years in planning scenarios
Struggling with open-ended planning simulations that require judgment
What to Prioritize
Focus your study time on these high-impact areas:

1
Focus on entity selection and restructuring - understand when each entity type is advantageous
2
Master retirement plan contribution limits, distributions, and penalties
3
Learn estate and gift tax planning strategies including annual exclusions and lifetime exemptions
4
Understand compensation alternatives - qualified plans, stock options, deferred compensation
5
Practice applying tax concepts to multi-year planning scenarios
Proven Study Strategies
TCP requires you to think like a tax advisor, not just a tax preparer. Every question should prompt you to ask: What would I recommend to this client and why?

If you've worked in tax, draw on that experience. TCP tests practical knowledge that experienced tax professionals use daily. Your work experience is valuable here.

Create comparison charts for retirement plans: contribution limits, catch-up provisions, distribution rules, and employer matching. These details are heavily tested.

Entity selection questions often have multiple acceptable answers. Focus on understanding the trade-offs rather than looking for one right answer.

Practice simulations that require you to analyze a client's situation and recommend planning strategies. The exam increasingly tests application over memorization.
