Why Candidates Fail REG
Based on our experience as CPAs, here are the most common reasons candidates struggle:

Trying to memorize tax rates and thresholds that change annually
Not understanding basis concepts - these flow through every topic
Underestimating business law - it's tested more heavily than most expect
Getting lost in the details of complex entity transactions
Poor calculation accuracy on tax computation simulations
What to Prioritize
Focus your study time on these high-impact areas:

1
Master basis calculations - original basis, adjusted basis, and basis in property received
2
Understand individual tax calculation flow from gross income to taxable income to tax
3
Focus on entity taxation differences - when income is taxed and how it flows to owners
4
Don't skip business law - contracts and agency are heavily tested and often easier points
5
Practice property transaction calculations until they're automatic
Proven Study Strategies
REG is best taken after FAR if you have tax experience, or can be taken early if you're fresh from a tax class. The material is detailed but follows logical patterns.

Create a flowchart for each entity type showing how income flows from the entity to the owner's return. Understanding this flow is more important than memorizing specific rules.

Basis is the most important concept in REG. If you understand basis, you can work through almost any property or entity transaction. Make this your foundation.

Business law topics follow common sense more than you'd expect. Think about what's fair and reasonable - contract law and agency often follow intuitive principles.

The IRS publishes forms and instructions that are excellent study materials. Understanding how a real 1040 or 1065 works helps you answer exam questions.
