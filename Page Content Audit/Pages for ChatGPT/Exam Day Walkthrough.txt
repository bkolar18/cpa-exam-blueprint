Week Before the Exam
The week before your exam is about finalizing your preparation and reducing stress, not cramming.

Confirm your exam appointment (check email confirmation)
Visit Prometric website to review testing center location
Do a practice drive to the testing center if unfamiliar
Review the AICPA sample tests one more time
Focus on weak areas but avoid cramming new material
Get your sleep schedule consistent (aim for 7-8 hours)
Prepare your ID documents (two forms required)
Day Before the Exam
Trust your preparation. Last-minute cramming does more harm than good.

Stop studying by early evening - rest your brain
Lay out your clothes and ID documents
Set multiple alarms (phone + backup)
Eat a normal dinner - nothing too heavy or unusual
Avoid alcohol and excessive caffeine
Go to bed at your normal time
Review your confirmation email one more time
What to Bring (and Leave Behind)
Bring These
Primary ID: Valid driver's license or passport
Secondary ID: Credit card with signature or another government ID
Confirmation email (printed or on phone - just in case)
Leave These Behind
Phone (leave in car or locker)
Smart watch or fitness tracker
Notes, books, or study materials
Food or drinks (except during breaks)
Wallet (beyond required IDs)
Jacket with large pockets (may be asked to remove)
Pro tip: Leave valuables in your car, not the Prometric locker. Lockers are small and you can't access them during the exam.

Prometric Check-In Procedures
1. ID Verification
You'll need two forms of ID. Your primary ID (driver's license or passport) must have your photo and signature. The name must exactly match your NTS - even middle names matter.

2. Biometric Scan
Prometric uses palm vein scanning technology. You'll scan your palm each time you leave and return to the testing room (including breaks).

3. Belongings Storage
Everything except your IDs goes in a small locker. This includes your phone, watch, wallet, and any other items. You'll keep the locker key with you.

4. Pocket Check
Staff will ask you to turn out your pockets and may check glasses frames. This happens every time you enter the testing room.

5. Photo & Signature
Your photo is taken and you'll sign digitally. This is used to verify your identity if you leave for breaks.

Exam Interface Overview
Calculator
An on-screen calculator is available. It's a basic calculator, similar to the Windows calculator. Practice with the AICPA sample tests to get comfortable with it.

Scratch Paper
You'll receive two double-sided noteboards (laminated paper) with markers. You can request more if needed by raising your hand.

Question Navigation
You can flag questions for review within a testlet. Once you submit a testlet, you cannot go back to it.

Exhibit Spreadsheets
TBS questions include Excel-like spreadsheets. You can sort and filter data, but functionality is limited compared to actual Excel.

Important: Take the AICPA sample tests at aicpa.org to familiarize yourself with the exact interface before exam day.

Time Management Strategies
General Time Guidelines
• MCQs: Average 1.5 minutes per question
• TBS: Average 10-15 minutes per simulation
• Break: Take your optional break between testlets 3 and 4
• Buffer: Aim to finish with 15-20 minutes to spare for review
If You're Running Out of Time
• Never leave a question blank - guess if needed
• On TBS, fill in what you can - partial credit exists
• Skip time-consuming questions and return if time permits
• Remember: Some questions are pretest (unscored), so don't panic
Taking Breaks
You get one official 15-minute break that doesn't count against your exam time. This occurs after the first set of TBS questions.

During Your Break:
• Use the restroom
• Have a quick snack from your locker
• Drink water
• Take deep breaths and reset mentally
Break Reminders:
• You must re-scan your palm when returning
• Time over 15 minutes counts against your exam
• You can take unofficial breaks, but time keeps running
After the Exam
Immediately After
You'll complete a brief survey. You will NOT see your score - scores are released by NASBA according to the score release calendar. Collect your belongings and head out.

Don't Second-Guess
Resist the urge to look up answers when you get home. It won't change anything and will only increase anxiety. What's done is done.

Celebrate the Effort
Regardless of outcome, you just completed a 4-hour professional exam. Do something nice for yourself - you earned it.

Score Release
Core section scores are released every 1-2 weeks. Discipline section scores are released quarterly. Check our Score Release Calendar for specific dates.

Track Your Score Release Date
Get notified when scores are released so you're not constantly refreshing.
