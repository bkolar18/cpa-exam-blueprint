About Your Notice to Schedule (NTS)
What is an NTS?
Your Notice to Schedule (NTS) is authorization from your state board to take the CPA exam. Once issued, you have 6 months to schedule and take your exam section.

What happens if it expires?
If your NTS expires before you take the exam, you'll need to reapply and pay the fees again. There are no refunds for unused NTS periods.

Best Practices
Schedule your exam within 30 days of receiving NTS
Book popular dates early - they fill up fast
Only apply for sections you're ready to take
NTS Fees by State
NTS fees vary by state, typically ranging from $50-$200 per section. Check your state board for exact fees.
