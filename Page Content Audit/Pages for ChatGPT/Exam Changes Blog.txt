The CPA profession is undergoing significant changes in 2026, with new licensure pathways that could reshape how candidates become CPAs. Here's what you need to know.

The Big Change: New Licensure Pathways
In 2025, AICPA and NASBA approved model legislation creating alternative pathways to CPA licensure. Starting in 2026, qualifying candidates may have three distinct routes to becoming a CPA.

Pathway 1: Traditional (150 Hours)
The familiar route remains available:

Bachelor's degree with accounting concentration
150 semester hours total
1 year of professional experience
Pass all four CPA Exam sections
Pathway 2: Post-Baccalaureate Degree
A streamlined option for graduate students:

Post-baccalaureate degree (Master's) with accounting concentration
1 year of professional experience
Pass all four CPA Exam sections
No need to reach 150 total hours if you have a Master's in accounting.

Pathway 3: Bachelor's + Extended Experience
The most significant new option:

Bachelor's degree with accounting concentration
2 years of professional experience (instead of 1)
Pass all four CPA Exam sections
This pathway eliminates the 150-hour requirement for candidates willing to gain an additional year of experience.

Why This Matters
Addressing the Talent Pipeline
The accounting profession has faced a well-documented talent shortage. Key factors:

Declining accounting major enrollments
Competition from tech and finance sectors
150-hour requirement seen as a barrier
These new pathways aim to bring more qualified professionals into the CPA pipeline while maintaining rigorous standards.

Cost and Time Savings
For candidates choosing Pathway 3:

Save 30 credit hours of additional education
Reduce student debt from graduate coursework
Enter workforce sooner (though with longer experience requirement)
Trade-Offs to Consider
Factor	150-Hour Path	Bachelor's + 2 Years
Education cost	Higher	Lower
Time to license	Similar	Similar
Experience required	1 year	2 years
Graduate credential	Possible	No
Starting salary	Varies	Varies
State Adoption Status
The new pathways require state-level legislative adoption. As of early 2026:

States That Have Adopted (14+ states)
States that have enacted legislation or amended rules include:

Texas (effective August 1, 2026)
Tennessee (effective January 1, 2026)
Minnesota (passed May 2025)
Additional states pending
States Under Consideration
Many states have legislation pending or are actively reviewing adoption.

Important Note
Even after AICPA/NASBA approval, you must check your specific state board for:

Adoption status
Effective dates
Specific requirements
Don't assume your state has adopted the new pathways without verification.

Tax Law Changes: OBBBA Impact
Beyond licensure pathways, 2026 brings significant tax law changes affecting the REG and TCP exam sections.

Timeline
Through June 30, 2026: Old tax provisions (expiring 2025) remain testable
Starting July 1, 2026: OBBBA provisions incorporated into REG and TCP
Strategic Implications
If you're taking REG or TCP:

Before July 1, 2026:

Study current tax law only
No need to learn OBBBA provisions yet
After July 1, 2026:

Must learn new OBBBA provisions
Ensure review materials are updated
Efficiency Consideration: If taking both REG and TCP, try to complete both before or after July 1, 2026. Taking REG before and TCP after means studying different tax law versions - inefficient.

CPA Exam Structure: No Major Changes
The core exam structure remains stable for 2026:

Core Sections (Continuous Testing)
FAR - Financial Accounting & Reporting
AUD - Auditing & Attestation
REG - Regulation
All three available year-round with scores released every 1-2 weeks.

Discipline Sections (Quarterly Testing)
Choose ONE:

BAR - Business Analysis & Reporting
TCP - Tax Compliance & Planning
ISC - Information Systems & Controls
Discipline sections tested in the first month of each quarter (January, April, July, October) with quarterly score releases.

18-Month Window
Once you pass your first section, you have 18 months to pass all remaining sections. This rolling window continues through 2026.

2026 CPA Exam Blueprint
The 2026 blueprint brings minor refinements rather than major changes:

Skill Levels Remain Consistent
Remembering and Understanding
Application
Analysis
Evaluation
Content Area Weights
Slight adjustments to content area percentages may occur. Always reference the most current AICPA Blueprint.

Planning Your Strategy for 2026
If You're Starting in 2026
Check your state's pathway options - Are new pathways available?
Evaluate your education status - Which pathway fits your situation?
Consider tax law timing - Plan REG/TCP around the July 1 cutoff
Build a realistic timeline - Account for 18-month window
If You're Already in Progress
Maintain your momentum - Complete sections you've started
Mind your 18-month clock - Don't let passed sections expire
Decide on REG/TCP timing - Before or after July 1, 2026
Stay informed - Rules may continue evolving
For Students Still in School
Track state adoption - Know your options before graduation
Consider your goals - Graduate degree valuable beyond CPA?
Start early - Many states allow sitting before 150 hours
Plan experience strategically - What type of work do you want?
What Doesn't Change
Despite the new pathways:

The CPA Exam itself remains the same national exam
Quality standards are maintained
License reciprocity continues between states
Continuing education requirements persist post-licensure
18-month testing window still applies
Common Questions
Q: Does this make becoming a CPA easier?
Not necessarily. The exam remains the same. The new pathways simply offer different combinations of education and experience. You still must pass all four sections.

Q: Should I wait for my state to adopt the new pathway?
Depends on your timeline. If you're close to 150 hours, continuing may be faster than waiting for legislative adoption and gaining an extra year of experience.

Q: Will my license be different based on which pathway I choose?
No. Once licensed, a CPA is a CPA. The credential is the same regardless of pathway.

Q: How do I know if my state has adopted the new pathways?
Contact your state board of accountancy directly or check their website. Adoption status is changing regularly as more states consider the legislation.

Stay Informed
The CPA landscape is evolving. To stay current:

Monitor your state board's website
Follow AICPA and NASBA announcements
Check your review course for updates
Join CPA candidate communities (Reddit r/CPA, etc.)
Your Next Steps
Determine which pathway applies to you
Verify your state's adoption status
Plan your exam timeline accordingly
Build your personalized study plan
The fundamentals haven't changed: prepare thoroughly, study consistently, and pass the exam. The new pathways simply offer more flexibility in how you get there.
