How Spaced Repetition Works
Cards you find easy will appear less frequently, while difficult cards will repeat more often. This optimizes your study time by focusing on what you need to learn most. Rate each card honestly for the best results.

Tips for Effective Flashcard Study
1
Review daily

Consistency beats intensity. 15 minutes daily is better than 2 hours once a week.

2
Be honest with ratings

If you struggled, mark it as Hard. The algorithm works best with honest input.

3
Clear due cards first

Prioritize cards that are due before adding new ones to your rotation.

4
Use with practice questions

Flashcards build recall; MCQs test application. Use both together.
