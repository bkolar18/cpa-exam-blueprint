About Task-Based Simulations
TBS are case-study style questions that test your ability to apply knowledge to realistic scenarios. Unlike MCQs, you can earn partial credit on TBS questions. Each simulation includes exhibits (documents, tables, memos) that you'll need to analyze to complete the requirements.
