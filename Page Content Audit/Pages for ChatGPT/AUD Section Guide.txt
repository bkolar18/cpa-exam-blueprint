Why Candidates Fail AUD
Based on our experience as CPAs, here are the most common reasons candidates struggle:

Approaching AUD like FAR - this section requires understanding, not memorization
Not understanding the flow of the audit process from planning to reporting
Confusing similar-sounding terms and concepts (e.g., types of audit reports)
Ignoring SSARS, SSAE, and other non-audit engagement standards
Struggling with the heavily simulation-based format of recent exams
What to Prioritize
Focus your study time on these high-impact areas:

1
Understand the audit process flow - planning, risk assessment, evidence, and reporting
2
Master audit report modifications - know when each type applies and exact wording
3
Focus on internal control concepts - COSO framework appears throughout the exam
4
Learn the differences between audits, reviews, compilations, and attestation engagements
5
Practice document review simulations - these are increasingly common on the exam
Proven Study Strategies
AUD is a great section to take early if you're working in audit. The concepts will be familiar, and passing it reinforces what you do at work every day.

Think like an auditor when studying. Ask yourself: What could go wrong? What evidence would I need? What would I conclude? This mindset helps you reason through questions.

Create comparison charts for similar concepts: types of opinions, types of engagements, types of sampling. The exam loves testing your ability to distinguish between similar items.

The AICPA releases old exam questions. Use these extensively for AUD - the question style is unique and takes practice to master.

Don't underestimate ethics and professional responsibilities. These topics appear throughout the exam and in simulations. AICPA Code of Professional Conduct is fair game.
