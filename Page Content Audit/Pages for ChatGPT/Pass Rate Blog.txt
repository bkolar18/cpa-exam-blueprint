Understanding CPA exam pass rates helps you set realistic expectations and plan your study strategy. Here's what the latest data tells us.

Current Pass Rates by Section (2024-2025)
Section	Pass Rate	Difficulty Ranking
TCP	72-82%	Easiest
REG	58-64%	Moderate
ISC	~51%	Moderate
AUD	46-50%	Challenging
FAR	40-43%	Very Challenging
BAR	33-40%	Hardest
What These Numbers Mean
The pass rates tell an important story: most first-time candidates don't pass on their first attempt. This isn't a reflection of intelligence - it's the nature of a rigorous professional exam.

Core Sections Analysis
FAR (Financial Accounting & Reporting) - 40-43%
FAR has the lowest pass rate among core sections for good reason:

Broadest content coverage of any section
Includes governmental, nonprofit, and for-profit accounting
Requires memorizing complex rules and their exceptions
Many candidates underestimate the time needed
If you're planning your study order, consider that FAR's low pass rate reflects its difficulty, not just its content volume.

AUD (Auditing & Attestation) - 46-50%
AUD challenges candidates because:

Heavy emphasis on professional judgment
Requires understanding audit procedures in context
Many questions are scenario-based
Can't just memorize - must apply concepts
REG (Regulation) - 58-64%
REG has the highest core section pass rate because:

Content is more straightforward (rules-based)
Tax law, while extensive, follows logical patterns
Business law section is often overlooked but scoreable
Candidates who work in tax have an advantage
Discipline Sections Analysis
TCP (Tax Compliance & Planning) - 72-82%
TCP consistently has the highest pass rate of all sections:

Builds on REG knowledge
Many candidates choose TCP as their discipline section
Tax professionals find it familiar
Clear, rule-based content
ISC (Information Systems & Controls) - ~51%
ISC appeals to candidates with IT backgrounds:

Technical content may intimidate accounting-focused candidates
Those with IT experience find it manageable
Growing field means more relevant practice material
BAR (Business Analysis & Reporting) - 33-40%
BAR has the lowest pass rate of any section:

Combines elements of FAR with data analytics
Requires deeper analysis skills
Relatively new section with less practice material
Many candidates underestimate its difficulty
Historical Trends
Pass rates have remained relatively stable over the years, with some notable patterns:

CPA Evolution (2024) caused initial dips as candidates adjusted to new format
Discipline sections initially had higher volatility as the question pool developed
Q1 historically lower - candidates rushing after busy season
Q3 typically highest - summer studying pays off
What Pass Rates Mean for Your Strategy
Don't Let Low Pass Rates Discourage You
A 40% pass rate doesn't mean only the top 40% of candidates can pass. It means:

Many candidates are underprepared
Some are testing their readiness without full preparation
Retakers eventually pass (you just see their first attempt in the stats)
Use Pass Rates to Plan Study Time
Lower pass rate sections deserve more study hours:

Section	Recommended Hours
FAR	120-150
BAR	100-130
REG	100-120
TCP	100-120
AUD	80-100
ISC	80-110
Consider Pass Rates in Section Order
Some candidates prefer to:

Start with FAR to tackle the hardest section with fresh energy
End with TCP to finish strong with the highest pass rate
Avoid BAR unless required (some career paths don't need it)
The Real Key to Passing
Pass rates are statistics. Your individual outcome depends on:

Adequate preparation time - Not rushing
Effective study methods - Active recall over passive reading
Practice questions - 2,000+ per section recommended
Consistent schedule - Small daily efforts beat weekend cramming
Mental preparation - Confidence matters on exam day
The Bottom Line
Pass rates provide context, not destiny. Candidates who study effectively, use quality materials, and maintain consistency pass at much higher rates than the averages suggest.

The question isn't whether you can pass - it's whether you're willing to put in the work required.
