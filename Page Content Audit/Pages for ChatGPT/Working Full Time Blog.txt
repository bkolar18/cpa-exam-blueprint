Working full-time while studying for the CPA exam isn't the exception - it's the norm. Most CPA candidates are juggling jobs, commutes, and life responsibilities. Here's how to make it work.

The Reality Check
Let's start with honesty: studying for the CPA exam while working full-time is hard. You'll sacrifice:

Weeknight relaxation
Some weekend activities
Sleep (occasionally)
Social events
Hobbies (temporarily)
But here's the good news: it's temporary. Most working professionals pass all four sections in 12-18 months. That's a finite period of sacrifice for a lifetime career credential.

How Many Hours Do You Really Need?
The math is straightforward:

Total hours needed: 400-500 for all four sections
Realistic study pace: 15-20 hours per week
Timeline: 6-12 months per section order
At 15 hours per week, you're looking at roughly:

FAR: 8-10 weeks
AUD: 5-7 weeks
REG: 7-8 weeks
TCP/BAR/ISC: 6-8 weeks
Building Your Weekly Schedule

Tuesday	7-8 PM	1
Wednesday	7-8 PM	1
Thursday	7-8 PM	1
Friday	Off	0
Saturday	9 AM - 2 PM	5
Sunday	9 AM - 3 PM	6
The 20-Hour Week (Recommended)
Day	Time Block	Hours
Monday	6-8 AM + 7-8 PM	3
Tuesday	6-7 AM + 7-8 PM	2
Wednesday	6-8 AM + 7-8 PM	3
Thursday	6-7 AM + 7-8 PM	2
Friday	6-7 AM	1
Saturday	8 AM - 1 PM	5
Sunday	8 AM - 12 PM	4
Time-Finding Strategies
Morning Study (Highly Recommended)
Mornings are powerful because:

Your brain is fresh
No meetings or interruptions
You start the day with progress
Evening plans don't derail studying
How to become a morning studier:

Set your alarm 1.5 hours earlier than needed
Go to bed 1 hour earlier
Prepare everything the night before
Have a consistent routine (coffee, desk, study)
Give it 2 weeks to become habit
Lunch Break Studying
Even 30 minutes is valuable:

Perfect for MCQ drills
Use mobile apps from your review course
Find a quiet spot (car, empty conference room)
Focus on review, not new material
Commute Time
If you commute by train or bus:

Audio lectures
Flashcard apps
Review notes on your phone
If you drive:

Audio lectures only (safety first)
Record yourself explaining concepts, play back
Weekend Blocks
Protect your weekend study time fiercely:

Tell friends/family your "class schedule"
Study at the same times each weekend
Leave the house if you have distractions
Reward yourself after study blocks
Surviving Busy Season (Accounting Specific)
If you work in public accounting, busy season planning is critical:

Before Busy Season
Pass as many sections as possible
At minimum, maintain your passed sections
Front-load your most difficult section
During Busy Season
Aim for 5-10 hours per week (maintenance mode)
Focus on MCQs only (quick, portable)
Don't attempt a new section
Don't schedule an exam during peak weeks
After Busy Season
Jump back in aggressively
Your brain remembers more than you think
Schedule your next exam within 4-6 weeks
Managing Energy, Not Just Time
Physical Energy
Sleep is non-negotiable (7+ hours)
Exercise, even briefly, boosts focus
Eat real food (brain fuel matters)
Limit alcohol (it kills next-day focus)
Mental Energy
Study your hardest material when freshest
Save easy review for tired times
Take real breaks (not phone scrolling)
One day per week completely off studying
Emotional Energy
Tell your support system what you're doing
Ask for help with household tasks
Accept that some things will slip
Celebrate small wins (passed MCQ sets, etc.)
Communication Scripts
With Your Manager
"I'm pursuing my CPA license over the next 12-18 months. I may occasionally need to adjust my schedule or decline optional overtime. I'm committed to maintaining my performance and want to keep you informed."

With Your Partner/Family
"I need about 15-20 hours per week for CPA studying. Can we look at our schedule together and find times that work? I also need one weekend study block protected. This is temporary - I'm targeting [month] to finish."

With Friends
"I'm in CPA exam mode for the next few months. I can still hang out, but I might need to leave early sometimes or skip some things. It's temporary, and I appreciate your understanding."

What to Do When You're Falling Behind
It happens. Life intervenes. Here's how to recover:

If You Miss a Few Days
Don't panic or guilt-spiral
Add 30 minutes to the next few sessions
Adjust your exam date if needed (no shame)
If You Miss a Week or More
Reassess your schedule honestly
Consider if external factors need addressing
Build in buffer time going forward
Brief review of prior material before continuing
If You're Consistently Missing Hours
Your schedule may be unrealistic
Consider reducing to 12-15 hours (longer timeline is fine)
Identify what's actually blocking you
Get an accountability partner
Sample Day-in-the-Life
5:30 AM
Wake up, coffee, settle at desk

5:45 - 7:15 AM
Study block: 30 MCQs + review wrong answers

7:15 - 8:00 AM
Get ready for work

8:00 AM - 6:00 PM
Work (plus 30-min lunch study: 20 MCQs)

6:00 - 7:00 PM
Commute (audio lecture), dinner

7:30 - 8:30 PM
Evening study: Review notes or TBS practice

9:00 PM
Wind down, bed by 10 PM

Daily total: 3 hours Weekly total: 15-20 hours with weekends

The Mindset That Gets You Through
It's a Marathon, Not a Sprint
You don't need to study 40 hours a week. Consistent, moderate effort over time beats burnout-inducing intensity.

Done is Better Than Perfect
A 75 and a 95 result in the same license. Don't over-prepare one section at the expense of finishing.

Comparison is the Thief of Joy
Some people pass faster. Some have more free time. Your only competition is yesterday's version of yourself.

This is Temporary
18 months from now, this will be behind you. Keep the end goal visible.

You Can Do This
Thousands of working professionals pass the CPA exam every year. They're not smarter than you - they just showed up consistently.

Build your schedule, protect your time, and trust the process. Your future self will thank you.
