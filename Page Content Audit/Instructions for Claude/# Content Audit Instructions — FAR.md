**Project:** Meridian CPA Review  
**Page:** FAR Section Guide  
**Audit Date:** 2026-01-13  
**Objective:** Maintain non-outcome-based language, avoid credential misrepresentation, and ensure consistency with platform-wide legal and marketing posture.

## Summary
The FAR Section Guide is educational, accurate in tone, and low-risk overall. Two phrases must be revised to remove implied professional credentialing and outcome-based language. One additional wording change is recommended for consistency.

## ❌ REQUIRED CHANGES (Must Implement)

### 1. Remove implied CPA credential authority
**Current Text:**
> Based on our experience as CPAs, here are the most common reasons candidates struggle:

**Issue:**  
Implies licensed CPA authorship and professional authority. This conflicts with Meridian CPA Review’s independent, AI-assisted content positioning and increases expectation risk.

**Replace With:**
> Based on common candidate patterns we’ve observed, here are the most common reasons candidates struggle:

### 2. Remove outcome-based “pass” language
**Current Text:**
> passing FAR first builds confidence for the other sections.

**Issue:**  
Reintroduces outcome-based language (“pass”) that has been intentionally removed across the platform.

**Replace With:**
> starting with FAR often helps build confidence for the remaining sections.

## ⚠️ RECOMMENDED CHANGE (Optional but Preferred)

### Clarify exam coverage phrasing
**Current Text:**
> these are heavily tested new standards

**Suggested Replacement:**
> these standards receive significant exam coverage

**Rationale:**  
Avoids sounding exam-identical or overly definitive while preserving meaning.
