# FAR Study Guide — Content Audit

## Summary
This page contains multiple instances of outcome-based language and certainty framing that must be softened to align with Meridian CPA Review standards.

## ❌ Required Changes
- Replace “Everything you need to pass FAR” → “A comprehensive guide to prepare for FAR”
- Replace all explicit “pass rate” mentions (e.g., “lowest pass rate”) → “historically reported exam difficulty”
- Replace “almost guaranteed” implications (e.g., “almost guaranteed” simulations) → remove certainty and reframe as “commonly encountered”

## ⚠️ Recommended Changes
- Soften “reliable point-getters” → “areas many candidates find approachable once understood”
- Replace “Don’t underestimate” with neutral advisory phrasing

## ✅ Approved Content
- Content breakdowns
