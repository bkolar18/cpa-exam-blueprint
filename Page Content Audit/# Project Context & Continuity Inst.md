# Project Context & Continuity Instructions
**Project Name:** Meridian CPA Review  
**Purpose:** Seamless transition to a new AI session with full context preserved

---

## Project Overview
Meridian CPA Review is an independent CPA exam preparation platform focused on:
- Practice-first learning
- Affordability
- Adaptive study tools
- Transparency and low legal risk

The platform provides:
- 6,000+ practice questions
- 500+ task-based simulations
- Adaptive learning (“Prime Meridian”)
- Study planning, progress tracking, and gamification
- Free full access during beta

There are **no pass guarantees** and **no claims of CPA, AICPA, or NASBA affiliation**.

---

## Core Positioning Rules (Critical)
All content must adhere to the following principles:

### ❌ Avoid everywhere
- “pass”
- “guarantee”
- “you will pass”
- “exam-identical”
- “CPA-approved”
- “vetted by CPAs” (unless literally true)

### ✅ Use instead
- prepare
- exam readiness
- build confidence
- study effectively
- unlimited access with no expiration
- independent exam preparation

Outcome-based language has been intentionally removed to reduce legal and expectation risk.

---

## Legal & Risk Posture
The project intentionally:
- Avoids outcome guarantees
- Uses educational framing only
- Discloses AI use centrally (About page + ToS only)
- Uses original content guided by official CPA Exam Blueprints
- Includes independence disclaimers (not affiliated with AICPA/NASBA)

AI is treated as a **means**, not a product feature.

---

## AI Content Disclosure Strategy
AI is disclosed:
- On the About page (AI-assisted workflows)
- Briefly in the ToS

AI is **not** disclosed:
- On individual blog posts
- On section guides
- In headers or footers

No per-article AI labeling is used.

---

## Content Audit Process (Ongoing)
Each content page is reviewed via:
- One audit file per page (`.md`)
- Instruction-style formatting
- Clear separation of:
  - ❌ Required changes
  - ⚠️ Recommended changes
  - ✅ Approved content

These audits are intended to be consumed by Claude Code or another AI coding assistant and applied verbatim.

---

## Section Guides (FAR, AUD, REG, TCP)
Guides should:
- Be educational and advisory
- Avoid credentialed authority claims
- Avoid outcome promises
- Provide study strategies and prioritization
- Use neutral, industry-standard language

Example safe phrasing:
- “Candidates often struggle with…”
- “Many candidates choose to…”
- “This section typically requires…”

---

## Homepage & Marketing Rules
Headlines and CTAs must:
- Avoid “pass” language
- Avoid guarantees
- Emphasize preparation, affordability, and structure

Approved themes:
- “Smart CPA Exam Prep”
- “Practice-first learning”
- “Affordable alternative”
- “Unlimited access with no expiration”

---

## Founder Context (Do Not Publicize)
- The founder is employed full-time
- No public “Founder” branding on LinkedIn
- Company LinkedIn page may exist independently
- Marketing currently focuses on:
  - Reddit
  - campus accounting associations
  - quiet beta users

---

## Instruction Priority for New AI Sessions
When assisting with this project:
1. Maintain consistency with existing language rules
2. Flag any reintroduction of outcome-based claims
3. Prefer conservative, defensible wording
4. Do not invent credentials or endorsements
5. Treat audits as implementation instructions, not suggestions

---

## Goal of Current Phase
- Finalize copy safely
- Complete audits page-by-page
- Prepare for wider beta launch
- Maintain low legal and reputational risk
