Content Audit Methodology — Meridian CPA Review


(Instructional Specification for AI Assistants)



Purpose of the Audit


The audit exists to ensure that all content pages for Meridian CPA Review are:

Legally low-risk

Consistent with non-outcome-based positioning

Credible but not overstated

Aligned across the entire site

Appropriate for an independent, AI-assisted educational platform



The audit is not about:

content accuracy in accounting

SEO optimization

copywriting creativity



It is specifically about risk, language discipline, and credibility alignment.

Core Principle (Anchor Rule)


Never imply exam outcomes, guarantees, or credentialed authority unless explicitly substantiated.


Everything in the audit flows from this rule.

Step-by-Step Audit Process


STEP 1: Scan for Outcome-Based Language (Highest Priority)


The auditor must identify any language that implies exam success.



❌ Red-flag terms
pass

fail

guarantee

succeed

“everything you need to pass”

“until you pass”

“learn what it takes to pass”

“proven to pass”

“exam success”



Why this matters
Even without a formal guarantee, repeated use of “pass”:

creates implied expectations

increases consumer protection risk

undermines earlier legal cleanup



Required action
Replace outcome language with preparation / readiness framing

Maintain meaning while removing promises



Approved replacements
prepare

exam readiness

build confidence

study effectively

unlimited access with no expiration

prepare for exam day

STEP 2: Identify Implied Authority or Credentials


The auditor checks for claims of professional authority.



❌ Red flags
“based on our experience as CPAs”

“CPA-vetted”

“reviewed by licensed professionals”

“expert-authored”

“industry-approved”



Why this matters
These claims:

increase legal duty of care

require substantiation

conflict with AI-assisted, independent positioning



Required action
Replace with observational or generalized phrasing



Approved replacements
“based on common candidate patterns”

“many candidates report”

“widely observed among candidates”

“based on typical study outcomes”

STEP 3: Check for Misrepresentation or Affiliation Risk


The auditor ensures the page does not imply affiliation with:

AICPA

NASBA

exam administrators

official CPA bodies



Risky phrasing
“exam-identical”

“official content”

“aligned exactly with the exam”

“approved by AICPA”



Approved framing
“guided by the CPA Exam Blueprints”

“based on publicly available exam frameworks”

“reflects tested topics and skills”



Blueprints are guidance, not content sources.

STEP 4: Evaluate AI Disclosure Consistency


The auditor confirms AI usage is:

disclosed centrally (About page / ToS)

not over-disclosed on individual pages



Rules
Section guides, blogs, and resources:

❌ No AI labeling required

About page:

✅ Clear AI-assisted workflow disclosure

ToS:

✅ Brief mention of automated systems



Over-disclosure is discouraged.

STEP 5: Look for Overly Definitive Exam Claims


The auditor flags language that implies certainty about:

exam weighting

question frequency

tested topics

“heavily tested” claims stated as fact



Required approach
Soften absolutes

Preserve usefulness



Example
❌ “This is heavily tested”

✅ “This area receives significant exam coverage”

STEP 6: Check Consistency with Global Site Rules


The auditor ensures the page does not contradict:

Homepage language

About page positioning

Refund posture

Absence of guarantees



If the site avoids “pass” language globally, no page may reintroduce it casually.



Consistency > individual page optimization.

STEP 7: Classify Findings


All findings must be categorized as:



❌ Required Changes
Legal risk

Outcome implication

Authority misrepresentation

Affiliation risk



These must be fixed.



⚠️ Recommended Changes
Tone alignment

Softening absolutes

Credibility polish



Optional but preferred.



✅ Approved Content
Educational guidance

Study strategies

Neutral descriptions

Calls to action without promises

Output Format Requirements


Each audit must produce a single .md file containing:

Summary

❌ Required Changes (with exact replacements)

⚠️ Recommended Changes

✅ Approved Content

Implementation rules (what NOT to add)



Audits are written as implementation instructions, not commentary.

Standards Referenced (Implicit, Not Legal Advice)


The audit approach aligns with:

General consumer protection principles (FTC-style truth-in-advertising norms)

Common ed-tech risk mitigation practices

Industry norms used by major CPA review providers (without relying on their legal privilege)

SaaS content liability best practices



No jurisdiction-specific law is assumed.

Mental Model for the Auditor


When reviewing a page, the AI should ask:



“If a skeptical student, regulator, or attorney read only this page in isolation, could it reasonably create an expectation of exam success or professional authority?”


If yes → revise.

Summary Instruction for Another AI


“Audit each page for outcome-based language, implied credentials, affiliation risk, and consistency with a non-guarantee educational platform. Replace ‘pass’ and authority claims with preparation-based, observational language. Output findings as a single instruction-focused .md file  per page with required vs recommended changes.”
