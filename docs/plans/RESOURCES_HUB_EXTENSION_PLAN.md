## Legal Compliance Audit

### Content Originality Assessment (Completed 2026-01-16)

#### Question Banks - ✅ COMPLIANT
- **Status**: All practice questions are ORIGINAL content
- **Verification**: No copyright notices, "adapted from", or "reprinted with permission" language found
- **Basis**: Questions test knowledge of accounting standards (FASB ASC, IRC, GAAS) which are factual/not copyrightable
- **Topic Structure**: Based on publicly available AICPA Blueprint topic areas (standard industry practice)

#### What We CAN Do (Legal):
| Content Type | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Original practice questions | ✅ | Our own questions on blueprint topics |
| Topic/skill structure from blueprint | ✅ | Facts about what's tested |
| References to accounting standards | ✅ | Standards are public/factual |
| Link to AICPA resources | ✅ | Linking is always permitted |
| Course comparisons | ✅ | Factual, editorial content |
| Aggregate public reviews | ✅ | With attribution |

#### What We CANNOT Do (Requires Permission):
| Content Type | Status | Action Required |
|-------------|--------|-----------------|
| Republish AICPA released questions | ❌ | Link only, don't copy |
| Copy questions from other providers | ❌ | Write original alternatives |
| Reproduce copyrighted course materials | ❌ | Describe, don't copy |

#### AICPA Permission Process (If Needed Later):
- **Email**: copyright-permissions@aicpa-cima.com
- **Mail**: Permissions Department, AICPA, 220 Leigh Farm Road, Durham, NC 27707
- **Example**: UWorld Roger has permission notice: "Reprinted by UWorld Roger CPA Review with permission"

### Recommendation for Free Resources Section
**LINK-ONLY APPROACH**: For AICPA sample tests and released questions, link directly to AICPA's official pages rather than republishing content. This is:
1. Legally safe (no permission needed)
2. Always current (AICPA updates their own content)
3. Builds trust (directing users to official sources)
