# Comprehensive CPA TBS Review – Batch 2 (Parts 1–5)

**Review Lens Applied (STRICT TBS STANDARD):**
- CPA Exam Task-Based Simulation grading model (partial credit risk)
- Explicit authoritative anchoring required (ASC / AU-C / IRC citations)
- Exam UI constraints enforced (signs, labels, account titles)
- TCJA provisions assumed active
- Ambiguity treated as a defect even if answers are directionally correct

## Summary

**Total TBS Reviewed:** 62  
**Batches Covered:** Batch 2 – Parts 1 through 5  
**Overall Status:** Approved with revisions required

| Batch Part | TBS Count | Status |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Part 1 | 15 | Needs revision |
| Part 2 | 15 | Approved |
| Part 3 | 15 | Approved |
| Part 4 | 15 | Needs revision |
| Part 5 | 2 | Approved |

## Part 1 – TBS_SAMPLE_BATCH2_PART1

**Status:** Needs revision

### Issues Identified
| Simulation | Issue Type | Description | Required Fix |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| Subsequent Events | Authoritative anchoring | Adjusting vs nonadjusting events not explicitly tied to whether conditions existed at the balance sheet date per ASC 855 | Add explicit instruction and explanation referencing ASC 855-10-25-1 and 25-3 |
| Subsequent Events | Partial credit risk | Disclosure wording ambiguous; correct classification may still lose credit | Clarify disclosure expectations consistent with CPA exam UI |
| Contingent Liabilities | Measurement ambiguity | Loss contingency does not specify whether a range exists or best estimate is available (ASC 450-20-30-1) | State whether a single estimate or range applies |
| Contingent Liabilities | Exam UI | Journal entry account titles not constrained to standard FAR terminology | Restrict selectable accounts to exam-accepted titles |
| Revenue Recognition | Clarity | Explanation references “earned” instead of control transfer | Replace language with ASC 606 control-transfer wording |
| Income Taxes | Technical clarity | Temporary differences not labeled taxable vs deductible | Require explicit classification before calculation |

**Assessment:** Content is conceptually strong but fails strict CPA TBS grading requirements.

## Part 2 – TBS_SAMPLE_BATCH2_PART2

**Status:** Approved

### Notes
- No truncation detected
- Calculations verified step-by-step
- ASC 606, 820, 205-20, 350, 740, 842 applications are accurate
- Authoritative logic is sufficiently explicit for CPA partial credit
- Journal entry simulations are UI-safe

**Assessment:** Exam-ready without revision.

## Part 3 – TBS_SAMPLE_BATCH2_PART3

**Status:** Approved

### Notes
- Research TBS correctly reference ASC 842-20-25-2
- ISC simulations properly reflect audit and IT risk judgment expectations
- REG simulations (AMT, FTC, innocent spouse, SOL) are technically accurate
- Numeric tolerances and explanations align with CPA exam mechanics

**Assessment:** High-quality TBS content; no revision required.

## Part 4 – TBS_SAMPLE_BATCH2_PART4

**Status:** Needs revision

### Issues Identified
| Simulation | Issue Type | Description | Required Fix |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| State Residency Planning | Technical accuracy | California residency safe harbor incorrectly stated as 45 days | Correct to 546 consecutive days or reframe question |

### Notes
- All other REG and TCP simulations are accurate and well-anchored
- Installment sales, PALs, IRMAA, QOZ, captive insurance, and basis calculations verified

**Assessment:** One material factual error requires correction.

---

## Part 5 – TBS_SAMPLE_BATCH2_PART5

**Status:** Approved

### Notes
- Partnership basis TBS correctly layers basis, at-risk, and deductibility limits
- Section 83(b) research simulation correctly cites IRC §83 and timing rules
- No ambiguity or partial-credit exposure identified

**Assessment:** Clean and exam-ready.

## Final Conclusions

### Strengths Across Batch 2
- Strong numerical accuracy
- Realistic CPA exam–style scenarios
- Good difficulty calibration
- High-quality REG and ISC simulations

### Systemic Improvement Areas
1. **Explicit authoritative anchoring** (especially ASC 855, 450, 740)
2. **UI-safe language** to protect partial credit
3. **Explicit classification steps** before calculations

Once the identified revisions are made, **Batch 2 will meet high-fidelity CPA exam TBS standards** suitable for live exam prepa
