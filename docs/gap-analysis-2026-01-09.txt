Date: January 9, 2026
Prepared by: External Consultant Review
================================================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This document outlines the gaps between the current CPA Exam Blueprint platform
and market-leading competitors (Surgent, Becker, Roger CPA, Wiley, Gleim).
The platform has a strong foundation but is missing several critical features
needed to compete effectively in the CPA exam prep market.

================================================================================
CURRENT PLATFORM STRENGTHS
================================================================================

1. Practice Questions System
   - MCQ practice with explanations
   - Filtering by section, topic, difficulty
   - Time tracking per question

2. Adaptive Learning Infrastructure
   - Topic-level performance tracking
   - Mastery levels (weak, moderate, mastered)
   - Priority-based question distribution

3. Gamification System
   - 24+ badges with progress tracking
   - 15+ achievements (visible and hidden)
   - Points, streaks, and tier system

4. Progress Tracking
   - Readiness dashboard with milestone progress bars
   - Per-section and per-topic analytics
   - Confidence calibration indicators

5. Study Management
   - Study session logging
   - NTS (Notice to Schedule) tracking
   - Personal notes with confidence ratings
   - Question flagging (return to, difficult, easy)

6. Admin Panel
   - User management
   - Question feedback review
   - Analytics dashboard
   - Announcement system

================================================================================
CRITICAL GAPS (HIGH PRIORITY)
================================================================================

1. TASK-BASED SIMULATIONS (TBS)
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Gap: Platform only has MCQs. Real CPA exam is ~50% simulations.

   Market Standard: All major providers have interactive TBS practice including:
   - Document Review Simulations
   - Journal Entry Simulations
   - Reconciliation Simulations
   - Research Simulations (authoritative literature lookup)

   Impact: Without TBS, students are only prepared for half the exam.

   Recommendation: Build comprehensive TBS system with multiple simulation types
   matching actual exam formats.

2. VIDEO LECTURES / CONTENT LEARNING
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Gap: Platform has practice questions but no teaching content.

   Market Standard:
   - Becker: 100+ hours of video per section
   - Roger: Engaging video lectures known for entertainment value
   - Surgent: Comprehensive video library

   Impact: Students need to learn concepts before being tested on them.

   Recommendations:
   - Partner with instructors to create video content
   - Curate/link to free resources (YouTube CPAs, AICPA materials)
   - Build text-based "lesson" modules that teach before quizzing

3. DIGITAL FLASHCARDS
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Gap: No flashcard system exists.

   Market Standard: Surgent, Becker, Roger all include flashcard decks
   with spaced repetition algorithms.

   Impact: Flashcards are essential for memorization-heavy content.

   Recommendation: Build spaced repetition flashcard system. Could auto-generate
   cards from questions users frequently miss.

4. MOBILE APP
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Gap: Web-only platform.

   Market Standard: Every major provider has iOS/Android apps.

   Impact: Students want to study during commutes, breaks, etc.

   Recommendations:
   - React Native for cross-platform development
   - Progressive Web App (PWA) as interim solution

5. OFFLINE ACCESS
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Gap: Requires constant internet connection.

   Market Standard: Download content for offline study.

   Impact: Lost study time during travel, poor connectivity situations.

   Recommendations:
   - Service worker caching for PWA
   - Downloadable content packs for mobile app

================================================================================
IMPORTANT GAPS (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
================================================================================

6. STUDY PLANNER / SCHEDULER
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Gap: Users log sessions manually but no automated study plan exists.

   Market Standard:
   - Surgent: Personalized day-by-day adaptive study plans
   - Becker: Structured study schedules with milestones

   Recommendation: Build planner that:
   - Takes exam date as input
   - Calculates hours needed per topic (based on AICPA weights)
   - Creates daily/weekly task lists
   - Adjusts based on actual progress

7. PERFORMANCE ANALYTICS DASHBOARD
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Gap: Basic stats exist but no deep analytics visualizations.

   Market Standard: Detailed breakdowns showing:
   - Performance trends over time (line charts)
   - Weak topic heatmaps
   - Time-of-day performance patterns
   - Comparison to other users (percentile ranking)

   Recommendation: Build dedicated analytics page with charts and insights.

8. QUESTION BANK SIZE TRANSPARENCY
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Gap: Unclear how many questions exist per section.

   Market Standard: "6,000+ MCQs" prominently displayed as selling point.

   Recommendation: Display question counts on practice pages and marketing.
   Users want assurance they won't exhaust the question bank.

9. WRITTEN COMMUNICATION PRACTICE
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Gap: No essay/written response practice.

   Market Standard: Writing prompts with sample answers and rubrics.

   Recommendation: Add writing prompts with:
   - Sample model answers
   - AI-powered feedback (optional enhancement)

10. AUDIO CONTENT / PODCASTS
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Gap: No audio learning option.

    Market Standard:
    - Surgent has audio lectures
    - Ninja CPA is famous for audio content

    Recommendation: Audio summaries of key topics for commute learning.

================================================================================
NICE-TO-HAVE GAPS (LOWER PRIORITY)
================================================================================

11. Live Classes / Webinars
    - Becker and Roger offer live instruction
    - High cost to implement and maintain

12. Instructor Q&A / Forums
    - Community features for student questions
    - Could use AI to answer common questions

13. 1-on-1 Tutoring
    - Premium add-on service
    - High operational cost

14. CPA Exam Updates Feed
    - Automatic notifications about AICPA changes
    - Score release dates
    - Testing window information

15. Print Materials
    - Physical textbooks and flashcards
    - Some students prefer paper study materials

16. Prometric Interface Simulator
    - Exact replica of Prometric testing software
    - Reduces exam-day anxiety through familiarity
