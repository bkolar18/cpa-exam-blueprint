Next steps:

- need to update contact us button to actually do something

- need to link choose topics section of ai flashcard generator to our topic taxonomy if not already done and then integrate with mcq and tbs analytics for topic progress

- need to add upcoming exam date in settings for pre-exam assessment to be linked to instead of NTS Tracker to allow users to access feature

- for the study guide generation, lets make it downloadable as pdf, txt, or word doc. lets also make the detail much more robust. when listing topucs and subtopics, explain concepts, use examples, be thorough in your explanations and include codifications, common mistakes, tips for each subtopic. do not recommend other cpa exam providers as supplements, the whole point of our product is to be a cheaper and complete alternative. 

- i didn't see the exam simulation debrief option in this screen https://www.meridiancpareview.com/dashboard/exam-simulation/aud. also, when i hit review on a tbs in this screen, it brings up a condensed review screen and we need it to behave like the study log tbs review (brings you view only mode of tbs)

- this page shouldn't exist: https://www.meridiancpareview.com/dashboard/practice/history. when we click on a multiple choice question session on this page https://www.meridiancpareview.com/dashboard/study-log, it should bring us right to the mcq session that the user clicked on, eg https://www.meridiancpareview.com/dashboard/practice/history?session=a028ce0b-7756-4a64-8866-e4cee12b48c3, which it currently does correctly. But when I hit Back to All sessions, the web page url changes from https://www.meridiancpareview.com/dashboard/practice/history?session=a028ce0b-7756-4a64-8866-e4cee12b48c3 to https://www.meridiancpareview.com/dashboard/practice/history but nothing visibly changes on the users page (content from https://www.meridiancpareview.com/dashboard/practice/history?session=a028ce0b-7756-4a64-8866-e4cee12b48c3 is still visible). if the user hits back to all sessions a second time, the screen changes to the https://www.meridiancpareview.com/dashboard/practice/history page, but it should be bringing us back to https://www.meridiancpareview.com/dashboard/study-log.

- in a similar vein as the last issue, we should change Practice Questions and Adaptive Practice Questions at the top of the multiple choice review page to Multiple Choice Questions and Adaptive Multiple Choice Questions. On this page: https://www.meridiancpareview.com/dashboard/practice/history?session=a028ce0b-7756-4a64-8866-e4cee12b48c3, we should change Practice History to Multiple Choice History and Back to Practice to Back to MCQ Practice. We should also change Back to All Sessions to Back to Study Log

- are we required to say Powered by Claude AI on our AI page? or can we just remove that?

- today should've been day 4 of my study streak but it updated to day 3 again.

- add advertisements for all added AI capabilities on website, do you recommend adding a separate ai capabilities page as well as adding descriptions for our ai capabilities on the how we compare page and home page? or is that too much mention of ai?
