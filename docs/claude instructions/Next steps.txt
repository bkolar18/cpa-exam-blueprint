Next steps:

- lets change: not yet exam ready to exam not yet recommended. (if this blurb changes to exam ready at some point we should make sure to change that language to not imply guarantees, instead have something like "excellent coverage achieved". 

- lets also change the sentence: Students who reach 80 on Meridian typically pass their section. because we do not want to insinuate that this means they will pass. it should be, Students who reach an 80 on Meridian are generally well-prepared for their section.

- on the meridian academy page we need to change Join thousands of CPA candidates using Meridian CPA Academy to stay organized and motivated. to Join CPA candidates using Meridian to stay organized and focused throughout their exam prep.

- the How many hours per week can you study? drop down options cant be seen in dark mode, need to change the text color, https://cpa-exam-blueprint.vercel.app/tools/study-hours-calculator

- lets change “Two forms of ID required”

This is the biggest risk.

“Prepare your ID documents (two forms required)”
“Secondary ID: Credit card with signature or another government ID”

⚠️ Problem:
For the CPA exam, only one valid, government-issued ID with photo and signature is required (driver’s license or passport). A second ID is not universally required anymore and varies by Prometric exam/program.

If a candidate shows up thinking they must have two IDs and panics, that’s bad. on this page https://cpa-exam-blueprint.vercel.app/guides/exam-day

and Score release timing certainty

“Core section scores are released every 1–2 weeks.”

⚠️ This is generally true, but NASBA release windows still vary.

✅ Safer:

Core section scores are typically released every 1–2 weeks, depending on testing volume.

- search the site for references of tips from experienced candidates, or any references of advice or strategies or testimonials from candidates. we have had no candidates use our platform and dont want to make claims we cant substantiate. some examples of this are here https://cpa-exam-blueprint.vercel.app/blog/far-section-complete-study-guide. replace instances of these with more appropriate language or remove the sections entirely. This is okay - "FAR is challenging, but thousands of candidates complete it every quarter. The difference in outcomes usually comes down to preparation quality, not intelligence." but this is not Final Tips from Experienced Candidates
"I scheduled FAR first and gave it the most time. Don't underestimate it." because that quote is fabricated. We should change tips from experienced candidates on the study guide pages to Practical Study tips and change the wuotes to general tips
