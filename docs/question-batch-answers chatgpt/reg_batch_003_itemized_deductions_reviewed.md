#### Critical / Material Issues Identified

**reg-003-010 – Casualty loss deduction**
- **Status:** needs-revision
- **CorrectAnswerVerified:** partially
- **Issue (accuracy):**
  - The explanation states that personal casualty losses must exceed **$100 per casualty**.
  - Under current law (TCJA, 2018–2025), the per-casualty floor is **$500**, not $100, for federally declared disasters.
- **Authoritative Basis:** IRC §165(h)(5), as amended by TCJA.
- **Suggestion:** Update explanation and tip to reflect the $500 per-casualty floor.

**reg-003-006 – Charitable cash contribution limit**
- **Status:** needs-revision (clarity)
- **CorrectAnswerVerified:** true
- **Issue (clarity):**
  - Explanation implies the 60% AGI limit is permanent.
  - The 60% limit is applicable through 2025; it is not technically permanent under current statute.
- **Suggestion:** Add language such as “through 2025 under current law” to avoid overstatement.

**reg-003-025 – Appreciated property election**
- **Status:** needs-revision (technical precision)
- **CorrectAnswerVerified:** true
- **Issue (taxonomy/clarity):**
  - Explanation references a “50% (now 60%) AGI limit,” which may confuse candidates.
  - The higher limit applies when electing **basis treatment**, not because the property is treated as cash.
- **Suggestion:** Clarify that electing basis treatment allows use of the **cash contribution AGI limits**, which are 60% for public charities.
