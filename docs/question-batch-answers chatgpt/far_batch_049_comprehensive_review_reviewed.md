### Errors
| Question ID | Issue Type | Description | Suggested Fix |
|-------------|------------|-------------|---------------|
| far-review-010 | Technical Accuracy | Lease classification explanation relies on legacy 75% / 90% bright-line tests, which are not codified under ASC 842. | Revise explanation to state that ASC 842 does not prescribe bright lines; percentages are CPA exam heuristics. Emphasize principle-based criteria (major part, substantially all). |

### Quality Notes
- All other correct answers verified and accurate under current US GAAP (2024–2025).
- Calculations reviewed and mathematically correct.
- Distractors are plausible and reflect common FAR misconceptions.
- Explanations are generally clear, educational, and exam-relevant.
- Terminology and standards references are current (ASC 205-40, 270, 275, 330, 606, 715, 805, 815, 842, etc.).
- Difficulty levels are appropriately aligned overall; the lease question difficulty is appropriate but explanation needs modernization.

**Overall Assessment:** Approved with minor revision required for lease classification explanation.
