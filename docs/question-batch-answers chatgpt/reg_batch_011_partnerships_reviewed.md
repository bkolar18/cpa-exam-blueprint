### CPA CONTENT REVIEW – reg-batch-011-partnerships

**Overall Status:** needs-revision

---

#### Critical / Material Issues Identified

**reg-011-023 – Contribution of property subject to liability (gain recognition)**
- **Status:** needs-revision
- **CorrectAnswerVerified:** true (numeric result), but explanation is flawed
- **Issue (accuracy & clarity):**
  - The explanation is internally inconsistent and introduces unsupported assumptions ("60% relief if 40% owner" then "assume 100% for simplicity").
  - The question does **not specify the partner’s post-contribution liability share**, which is essential to applying IRC §752 correctly.
  - As written, the explanation implies full debt relief without clearly stating that the partner is relieved of the entire $60,000 liability.
- **Correct Technical Treatment:**
  - Gain is recognized **only to the extent that debt relief exceeds the partner’s adjusted basis**, after considering the partner’s share of the liability post-contribution.
  - If the partner is relieved of the full $60,000 and has basis of $50,000, recognized gain = $10,000.
- **Suggestion:**
  - Either:
    - Explicitly state that the partner has **no share of the liability after contribution**, or
    - Revise the explanation to clearly walk through §752 debt allocation without hypothetical ownership assumptions.

#### Minor / Clarity Improvements Recommended

**reg-011-022 – Allocation of nonrecourse liabilities**
- **Status:** approved with note
- **Issue (clarity):**
  - Tip oversimplifies allocation as purely profit ratios.
- **Suggestion:**
  - Add language acknowledging the full three-tier allocation under Reg. §1.752-3, even if simplified for exam purposes.

**reg-011-013 – Separately stated items**
- **Status:** approved with note
- **Issue (clarity):**
  - Depreciation can be separately stated in certain contexts (e.g., §179, AMT preferences), though not required here.
- **Suggestion:**
  - Clarify that *regular MACRS depreciation* is included in ordinary income for this question’s scope.

#### Approved Questions
All other questions:
- Correct answer verified
- Explanations technically accurate under current IRC and TCJA-era law
- Distractors plausible and exam-aligned

### Summary
