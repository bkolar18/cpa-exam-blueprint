## tcp-batch-005 Review

**Questions Reviewed:** 35  
**Issues Found:** 1

### Errors
| Question ID | Issue Type | Description | Suggested Fix |
|-------------|------------|-------------|---------------|
| tcp-005-023 | Answer Ambiguity | Both options B (operations cease completely) and C (partnership merged into another partnership) can cause a partnership to terminate under current law, making the question ambiguous. | Revise question to exclude mergers/divisions from the answer choices, or reword the stem to specify "other than a merger or division." |

### Quality Notes
- All other correct answers verified against current federal tax law (IRC §§ 701–777, TCJA, Treasury Regulations).
- No calculation errors identified.
- Distractors are generally strong and reflect common partnership tax misconceptions.
- Explanations are technically accurate, exam-relevant, and educational.
- Difficulty alignment is appropriate overall; hard questions properly test judgment and integration.

**Overall Assessment:** Approved with one required revision due to ambiguity.
