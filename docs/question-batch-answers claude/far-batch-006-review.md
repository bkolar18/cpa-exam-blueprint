## Content Accuracy Review

### Critical Standards Verified

**Goodwill Accounting (CRITICAL - CPA Exam Focus):**
- **far-int-003:** Correctly states goodwill is NOT amortized (public companies), tested for impairment annually
- **far-int-004:** Correctly applies simplified impairment test per ASU 2017-04
- **far-int-024:** Correctly describes private company alternative (10-year amortization, trigger-based testing)

**R&D Costs:**
- **far-int-009:** Correctly states R&D expensed as incurred under US GAAP
- **far-int-010:** Correctly identifies patent legal fees as capitalizable (not R&D)
- **far-int-018:** Correctly describes acquired IPR&D as indefinite-life until complete/abandoned

**Software Costs:**
- **far-int-012:** Correctly identifies capitalization point for internal-use software
- **far-int-013:** Correctly identifies technological feasibility as capitalization point for external software
- **far-int-020:** Correctly addresses cloud computing implementation costs (ASU 2018-15)

### Calculations Verified

| Question | Topic | Calculation | Result |
|----------|-------|-------------|--------|
| far-int-002 | Goodwill | $5M - ($4.2M - $1.5M) = $2.3M | CORRECT |
| far-int-004 | Goodwill impairment | $10M - $8M = $2M (< $3M GW) | CORRECT |
| far-int-007 | Patent amortization | $480K / 8 yrs = $60K | CORRECT |

### Detailed Calculation Verification

**far-int-002 (Goodwill Calculation):**
- Purchase price: $5,000,000
- Net identifiable assets: $4,200,000 - $1,500,000 = $2,700,000
- Goodwill: $5,000,000 - $2,700,000 = **$2,300,000** ✓

**far-int-004 (Goodwill Impairment):**
- Carrying amount: $10,000,000 (including $3M goodwill)
- Fair value: $8,000,000
- Impairment: $10M - $8M = $2M
- Limited to goodwill balance: $2M < $3M, so loss = **$2,000,000** ✓
