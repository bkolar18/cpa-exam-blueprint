## Issues Requiring Correction

### Batch 044: far-gov-adv-008 (Government-wide Conversion)

**Issue Type:** Calculation Error

**Question:** Convert fund expenditures to government-wide expenses: Equipment $300,000 (10-year life), Principal $200,000, Interest paid $50,000 (includes $10,000 prior accrual).

**Marked Answer:** C ($470,000)
**Calculated Answer:** $480,000 (D)

**Math:**
- Equipment: $300,000 - $30,000 depreciation = decrease $270,000
- Principal: $200,000 - $0 = decrease $200,000
- Interest: $50,000 - $40,000 = decrease $10,000
- **Total decrease: $480,000**

The explanation acknowledges the $10,000 interest adjustment but incorrectly omits it from the total.
