## Issues Identified

## Corrections Needed
1. Update difficultyMix in header to: {"easy": 6, "medium": 15, "hard": 14}
2. Update batchId to: "tcp-batch-005" for consistency

## Quality Assessment
- Comprehensive partnership planning coverage
- Excellent basis and allocation rules content
- Strong Section 754 and hot asset coverage
- Good anti-abuse and disguised sale questions
- Current law (TCJA technical termination repeal, Section 1061)
- Advanced carried interest and profits interest content
- Well-structured complexity progression
- Practical planning scenario applications
