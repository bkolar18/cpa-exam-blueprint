## Critical Issue Requiring Correction

### Batch 019: far-changes-006

**Issue Type:** CRITICAL - Wrong Answer Marked

**Question:** Equipment cost $100,000, salvage $10,000, original life 10 years. After 4 years, remaining life is revised to 4 years. What is Year 5 depreciation?

**Marked Answer:** C ($15,000)
**Correct Answer:** B ($13,500)

**Calculation:**
1. Original depreciation: ($100,000 - $10,000) / 10 = $9,000/year
2. Accumulated after 4 years: $36,000
3. Book value: $64,000
4. New depreciation: ($64,000 - $10,000) / 4 = **$13,500**

**Note:** The explanation text itself acknowledges this error with "Wait—let me recalculate" and concludes "Actually the answer should be B."

**Required Action:** Change correctAnswer from "C" to "B"
