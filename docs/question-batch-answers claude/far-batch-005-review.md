## Content Accuracy Review

### Key Standards Verified

- **Impairment two-step test (far-ppe-013):** Correctly describes undiscounted CF test followed by fair value measurement
- **No impairment reversal (far-ppe-014):** Correctly states US GAAP prohibits reversal for assets held for use
- **ARO accounting (far-ppe-016, far-ppe-017):** Correctly describes capitalization and accretion
- **Component depreciation (far-ppe-011):** Correctly states it's permitted but not required under US GAAP (required under IFRS)

### Calculations Verified

| Question | Topic | Calculation | Result |
|----------|-------|-------------|--------|
| far-ppe-005 | Interest capitalization | $120K + $30K = $150K | CORRECT |
| far-ppe-006 | Straight-line | ($50K - $5K) / 5 = $9K | CORRECT |
| far-ppe-007 | DDB Year 1 | $100K × 40% = $40K | CORRECT |
| far-ppe-008 | Units-of-production | 30K × $0.40 = $12K | CORRECT |
| far-ppe-009 | Sum-of-years-digits | $54K × 3/10 = $16.2K | CORRECT |
| far-ppe-010 | Partial year | $6K × 9/12 = $4.5K | CORRECT |
| far-ppe-013 | Impairment loss | $500K - $380K = $120K | CORRECT |
| far-ppe-017 | ARO accretion | $100K × 6% = $6K | CORRECT |
| far-ppe-019 | Exchange gain | $25K - $20K = $5K | CORRECT |
| far-ppe-021 | Basket purchase | $600K × 66.67% = $400K | CORRECT |
| far-ppe-024 | Disposal gain | $10K - $8K = $2K | CORRECT |
| far-ppe-028 | Boot proportional gain | $10K × 16% = $1.6K | CORRECT |

### Detailed Calculation Verification

**far-ppe-005 (Interest Capitalization):**
- Construction loan: $1,500,000 × 8% = $120,000
- Remaining expenditures: $500,000 × 6% = $30,000
- Total capitalizable: **$150,000** ✓

**far-ppe-009 (Sum-of-Years-Digits):**
- SYD = 4+3+2+1 = 10
- Depreciable base = $60,000 - $6,000 = $54,000
- Year 2 fraction = 3/10
- Year 2 depreciation = $54,000 × 3/10 = **$16,200** ✓

**far-ppe-028 (Boot Received Without Commercial Substance):**
- Total gain = $50,000 - $40,000 = $10,000
- Boot proportion = $8,000 / $50,000 = 16%
- Recognized gain = $10,000 × 16% = **$1,600** ✓
