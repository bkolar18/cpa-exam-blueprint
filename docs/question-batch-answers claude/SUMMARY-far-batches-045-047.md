## Issues Requiring Correction

### Batch 046: far-consol-adv-020 (NCI with Preferred Stock)

**Issue Type:** Calculation Error

**Question:** Subsidiary has common (80% parent-owned) and 10% cumulative preferred ($1M par, outsider-owned). Net income $200,000. What is NCI share?

**Marked Answer:** B ($140,000)
**Calculated Answer:** $120,000 (D)

**Math:**
- Preferred dividend: 10% × $1,000,000 = $100,000 (to NCI)
- Income to common: $200,000 - $100,000 = $100,000
- NCI common: 20% × $100,000 = $20,000
- **Total NCI: $100,000 + $20,000 = $120,000**

Answer B incorrectly calculates NCI common as 20% × $200,000 = $40,000, failing to subtract preferred dividends first.
