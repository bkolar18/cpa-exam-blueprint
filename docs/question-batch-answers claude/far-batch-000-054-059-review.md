## Content-Specific Issues

### far-batch-057 (Medium Mixed 2)
**Question far-med3-051 - Cumulative Preferred Stock Dividends**
- **Given:** 10,000 shares of 6% cumulative preferred ($100 par), no Year 1 dividends, $150,000 declared in Year 2
- **Calculation in explanation:** Preferred = 10,000 × $100 × 6% = $60,000/year. Arrears + Current = $120,000. Common = $150,000 - $120,000 = $30,000
- **Issue:** Correct answer listed as D ($90,000) but calculation yields $30,000 (Answer B)
- **Recommendation:** Correct answer should be B ($30,000), OR verify if question data was intended differently
