        "C": "Default risk",
        "D": "Documentation risk"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Detection risk (DR) is the risk that audit procedures will not detect a material misstatement. It is the only component of audit risk that auditors can directly control through the nature, timing, and extent of procedures. Inherent risk (IR) and control risk (CR) exist independently of the audit.",

        "D": "Detection risk is eliminated"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "There is an inverse relationship between assessed IR/CR and acceptable DR. When IR and CR are high, the auditor must set DR low to maintain acceptable audit risk. Low DR requires more persuasive audit evidence (more extensive procedures, more reliable evidence, closer to year-end testing).",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Inherent risk is higher when accounts involve estimates, judgments, or complex calculations. Inventory with complex products requiring estimation (for obsolescence, lower of cost or NRV) has higher inherent risk than commodities with readily determinable values. Stable prices and experienced management reduce inherent risk.",

        "D": "Can rely entirely on controls for evidence"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Assessing control risk at maximum (100%) means the auditor either believes controls are not effective or has decided not to test controls (often because substantive procedures alone would be more efficient). This requires more extensive substantive testing to compensate. The auditor cannot skip substantive procedures.",
