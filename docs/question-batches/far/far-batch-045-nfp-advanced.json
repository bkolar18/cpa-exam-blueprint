      "explanation": "Under ASC 958-605, a conditional contribution has both a barrier (matching requirement) and a right of return/release if the condition is not met. The matching requirement is a barrier that must be overcome. Historical success in meeting conditions does not change the accounting - it remains conditional until the barrier is actually met. Revenue is recognized when the condition is substantially met.",
