'Available' typically means collectible within the current period or soon enough thereafter to pay current liabilities (usually 60 days).

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Under GASB standards, special items are significant transactions within management's control that are either unusual in nature or infrequent in occurrence. Unlike FASB (which eliminated extraordinary item classification), GASB still distinguishes special items. A major facility sale is within management's control and unusual for the city, making it a special item reported separately in the statement of activities. GASB has not defined 'extraordinary items' the same way FASB previously did.",
