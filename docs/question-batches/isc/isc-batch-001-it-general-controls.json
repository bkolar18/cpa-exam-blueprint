        "D": "Database administrators can process transactions"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Proper IT segregation of duties ensures computer operators cannot modify programs, programmers cannot access production data, and DBAs are separated from transaction processing. This prevents unauthorized changes and reduces fraud risk.",

      },
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Strong password policies include minimum length (12+ characters), complexity requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters), and reasonable expiration periods. While too-frequent changes can lead to weak passwords, periodic rotation (90 days) balances security and usability.",
