Next steps:

- On MCQs, theres a report button that looks like a flag. Lets change the report function to a triangle with an exclamation point in the middle. Lets then add a flag option to each question since we have a flagged questions page for students to come back to. Make sure MCQs are properly linked to the Flagged Questions page (similar to the My Notes page). Also, ensure that TBS flagged questions are linked properly because i just tested that feature and the question did not appear on the Flagged Questions page

- For exam simulations, ensure there is a proper mix of questions from various topics. I just did an exam simulation with no calculation questions at all, it was all terminology or conceptual.

- Also for exam simulations with TBS's, when I submit the first TBS, I am met with a results screen. we should remove the results screen during an exam simulation and just move on to the next sim once the first is submitted. (or move directly to the Review Before Submitting page if only one TBS)

- I did a sim called Attributes Sampling for Tests of Controls. I had two answer options: Enter Your Answers
Enter numeric values. Use negative numbers or parentheses for negative amounts.

Sample Deviation Rate (%)

but the review button said I needed four answers: Answer Status

1.

2.
Sample Deviation Rate (%)
(1 pt)
Complete

3.
Is Upper Deviation Limit likely to exceed Tolerable Rate?
(1 pt)
Unanswered

4.
Sampling Conclusion
(2 pts) unanswered. there was nowhere to answer the second two questions. we need to ensure that that does not happen. 

- On the exam simulation review page, the MCQ Review section is hard to read because the whole section has a gray background in dark mode. Make sure it is legible in dark mode. 

- For exam simulations, we should allow users to review recent exams (add to study log page automatically upon completion)

- also on exam simulations, the review and submit button just brings you straight to the sims. either allow the user to review their answers or change the button to just say Submit. Also add the words MCQ Section to the button so they dont think its for each individual MCQ and move the button to the top ribbon with the timer (button on the top ribbon, says Review & Submit MCQ Section, or Submit MCQ Section).

- on exam simulations, remove the library button on sims

- on exam simulations, when im highlighting an MCQ question in dark mode, it becomes unreadable (box is highlighted white, text is white)

- on exam simulations remove the individual timer from simulations (should only be the exam timer on). also allow users to pause the exam timer when theyre on sims.
