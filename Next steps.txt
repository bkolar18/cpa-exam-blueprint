Next steps:

- looks like the library with back arrow is still visible on the simulation page during an exam simulation. we need to remove it

- when i submit the first simulation on an exam simulation, it brings me to the next sim but locks the top tool bar (cant go back to the other sim, the submit button says Submitted, and the second sim is locked (cant input answers)

- mcq questions are still unreadable in exam simulations in dark mode when selected/clicked on (cell fills white which is the color of the text)

- need to add pause button to TBS section of exam simulation
