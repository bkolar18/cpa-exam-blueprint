- "Quality content. Our practice questions are created using AI technology based on official CPA exam blueprints, with automated review for accuracy and relevance." lets replace this blurb on our about page with "Quality Content
Our practice questions are original and created using AI-assisted workflows guided by the official CPA Exam Blueprints. The blueprints inform topic coverage, structure, and skill weighting, while each question undergoes automated validation checks for relevance, logical consistency, and alignment with exam concepts."

and then add a footer at the bottom of the table:
Meridian CPA Review is an independent exam preparation platform and is not affiliated with the AICPA or NASBA.
