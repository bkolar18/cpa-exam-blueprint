## Issues Requiring Correction

### Batch 031: far-lease-adv-016 (Sales-Type Lease Profit)

**Issue Type:** CRITICAL - Wrong Answer

**Question:** Sales-type lease with CV $80,000, FV $100,000, PV payments $95,000, PV unguaranteed residual $5,000. What profit at inception?

**Marked Answer:** A ($15,000)
**Correct Answer:** B ($20,000)

**Calculation per ASC 842:**
- Revenue = $95,000 (lower of FV or PV)
- COGS = $80,000 - $5,000 (PV residual) = $75,000
- Profit = $95,000 - $75,000 = **$20,000**

### Batch 032: far-inv-adv-011 (Gross Profit Method)

**Issue Type:** Calculation Inconsistency

**Question:** BI $80K, Purchases $420K, Sales $600K, GP rate 30%. Ending inventory?

**Marked Answer:** B ($100,000)
**Calculated Answer:** Based on stated facts = **$80,000**

**Math:**
- Available = $500,000
- COGS = $600,000 × 70% = $420,000
- Ending = $500,000 - $420,000 = $80,000
