## Issues Requiring Correction

### Batch 042: far-calc2-009 (Revised Depreciation)

**Issue Type:** Calculation Inconsistency

**Question:** Asset cost $200,000, salvage $20,000, 10-year life. After 4 years, remaining life changes to 4 years. What is Year 5 depreciation?

**Marked Answer:** C ($28,000)
**Calculated Answer:** $27,000

**Math:**
- CV at change = $200,000 - $72,000 = $128,000
- New depreciation = ($128,000 - $20,000) / 4 = $27,000

The explanation acknowledges "$27,000. Closest is $28,000" - this is inconsistent.
