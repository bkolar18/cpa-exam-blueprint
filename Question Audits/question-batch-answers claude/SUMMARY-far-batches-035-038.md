## Issues Requiring Correction

### Batch 037: far-oci-027 (Treasury Stock Retirement)

**Issue Type:** CRITICAL - Wrong Answer

**Question:** Treasury stock (cost $40/share, 1,000 shares) retired. Original: $5 par, $12 APIC per share. What is debited to APIC?

**Marked Answer:** C ($23,000)
**Correct Answer:** B ($12,000)

**Calculation:**
- APIC debited = original APIC = 1,000 × $12 = $12,000
- The $23,000 excess goes to Retained Earnings, not APIC

### Batch 037: far-oci-029 (Warrant Exercise)

**Issue Type:** CRITICAL - Wrong Answer

**Question:** Warrants (APIC-Warrants $5,000) exercised for 500 shares at $25. What is credited to APIC-Common?

**Marked Answer:** B ($7,500)
**Correct Answer:** D ($12,500)

**Calculation:**
- Cash received: $12,500
- Plus warrant transfer: $5,000
- Less Common Stock (par): $5,000
- APIC-Common = $12,500

Note: The explanation in the question itself concludes $12,500 but contradicts the marked answer.
