## Issue Requiring Review

### Batch 027: far-calc-005 (DV-LIFO Calculation)

**Issue Type:** Questionable Answer/Inconsistent Explanation

**Question:** Base year inventory at base-year cost: $100,000. Current year inventory at current-year cost: $132,000. Current price index: 110. What is ending inventory at DV LIFO?

**Marked Answer:** C ($110,000)

**Expected Calculation:**
1. Current at base prices: $132,000 ÷ 1.10 = $120,000
2. Layer at base: $120,000 - $100,000 = $20,000
3. Layer at current: $20,000 × 1.10 = $22,000
4. Total: $100,000 + $22,000 = **$122,000**

**Problem:** The explanation states both "$20,000 × 1.10 = $22,000" and then contradicts itself with "Using standard DV-LIFO: $100,000 base + $10,000 layer = $110,000"

**Recommendation:** Revise the question numbers or answer choice to create a consistent, correct problem.
