## Issue Requiring Correction

### Batch 030: far-rev-adv-016 (Loyalty Points Allocation)

**Issue Type:** Calculation Inconsistency

**Question:** Customer purchases $200 of goods, earns 1,000 loyalty points worth $0.05 each (80% expected redemption). SSP of goods = $200. What revenue is recognized at the sale?

**Marked Answer:** C ($181.82)

**Expected Calculation:**
1. Points SSP = 1,000 × $0.05 × 80% = $40
2. Total SSP = $200 + $40 = $240
3. Goods allocation = $200 × ($200 / $240) = **$166.67**

**Problem:** The answer $181.82 is mathematically inconsistent with the stated facts. The explanation also contains self-doubt language ("Wait, let me recalculate...").

**Recommendation:** Revise either the answer or the question parameters to achieve consistency.
