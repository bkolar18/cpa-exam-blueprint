## Issues Requiring Correction

### Batch 039: far-tax-adv-021 (Current Tax Payable)

**Issue Type:** Calculation Inconsistency

**Question:** Pretax book income $400,000; depreciation book $30K/tax $50K; municipal interest $10K; rate 21%. What is current tax payable?

**Marked Answer:** A ($67,620)
**Calculated Answer:** $77,700

**Math:**
- Taxable income = $400,000 - $20,000 - $10,000 = $370,000
- Tax payable = $370,000 × 21% = $77,700

The explanation text in the question shows uncertainty and doesn't arrive at the marked answer.
