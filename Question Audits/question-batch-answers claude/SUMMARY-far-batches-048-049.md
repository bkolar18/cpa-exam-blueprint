**Question:** Convertible bonds EPS calculation with $500K NI, 100K shares, $1M of 6% bonds convertible to 20K shares, 25% tax.

**Marked Answer:** C ($4.13)
**Calculated Answer:** $4.54 (B)

### Batch 048: far-calc3-014 (Equity Method Income)

**Issue Type:** Calculation Error

**Question:** 30% ownership, cost $900K, BV $2.5M, excess to equipment (10-year life), investee NI $400K.

**Marked Answer:** B ($117,500)
**Calculated Answer:** $105,000 (C)

**Math:**
- Excess = $900K - $750K = $150K

### Batch 049: far-review-004 (Lower of Cost or NRV)

**Issue Type:** Answer Error

**Question:** Cost $50, selling price $60, completion costs $8. What is inventory value?

**Marked Answer:** B ($52)
**Correct Answer:** A ($50)

**Analysis:**
- NRV = $60 - $8 = $52
- Lower of Cost ($50) or NRV ($52) = $50

The explanation calculates correctly but marks wrong answer.

### Batch 049: far-review-010 (Lease Classification)

**Issue Type:** Conceptual Error

**Question:** 4-year lease, 6-year asset life, payments = 85% of FV.

**Marked Answer:** B (Finance lease)
**Correct Answer:** A (Operating lease)

**Analysis:**
- Life test: 4/6 = 67% (< 75%)
- Value test: 85% (< 90%)
- Neither criterion met = Operating lease
