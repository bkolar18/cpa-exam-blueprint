## ISSUES FOUND

### far-review-004: LOWER OF COST OR NRV ERROR

**Question:** Inventory: Cost $50, selling price $60, completion costs $8, normal profit margin 10%. What is inventory value under lower of cost or NRV?

**Marked Answer:** B ($52)

**Correct Calculation:**
- NRV = Selling price - Costs to complete = $60 - $8 = $52
- Cost = $50
- **Lower of Cost or NRV = $50**

**Correct Answer:** A ($50)

Note: The explanation acknowledges "Lower of cost ($50) or NRV ($52) = $50" but then marks the wrong answer.

### far-review-010: LEASE CLASSIFICATION ERROR

**Question:** 4-year lease for equipment with 6-year useful life. Lease payments = 85% of FV. How should lessee classify?

**Marked Answer:** B (Finance lease)

**Correct Analysis:**
- Life test: 4/6 = 67% (does NOT meet ≥75% threshold)
- Value test: 85% (does NOT meet ≥90% threshold)
- No other criteria mentioned (transfer, BPO, specialized use)

**Correct Answer:** A (Operating lease)

Note: The explanation acknowledges neither test is met but marks it as finance lease.
