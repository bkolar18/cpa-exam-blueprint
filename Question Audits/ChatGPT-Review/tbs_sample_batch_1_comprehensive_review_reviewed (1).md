# Comprehensive CPA TBS Review – Batch 1 (Parts 1–5) **REVIEWED**

**Review Standard Applied (STRICT CPA TBS LENS):**
- CPA Exam Task-Based Simulation grading (partial-credit sensitive)
- Explicit authoritative anchoring required (ASC / AU-C / IRC / Circular 230 / UCC)
- Exam UI constraints enforced (labels, signs, account titles, tolerances)
- TCJA provisions assumed active
- Ambiguity treated as a defect even if numerically correct

## Executive Summary

**Overall Status:** Approved with revisions required (STRICT lens)

| Part | TBS Count | Status |
|-----|----------|--------|
| Part 1 (AUD) | 15 | Needs revision |
| Part 2 (BAR) | 15 | Approved |
| Part 3 (FAR) | 15 | Needs revision |
| Part 4 (ISC / REG / TCP) | 15 | Needs revision |
| Part 5 (TCP) | 4 | Approved |

Primary issue themes:
- Missing or implicit authoritative anchoring (ASC 855, 450, 740; AU-C 240, 501)
- Partial-credit risk due to ambiguous instructions or UI constraints
- A small number of technical inaccuracies noted below

## Part 1 – AUD (tbs-aud-061 through tbs-aud-024)

**Status:** Needs revision

### Issues
| TBS ID | Issue Type | Description | Required Fix |
|------|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| tbs-aud-061 | Anchoring | Fraud responses correct but not explicitly tied to AU-C 240 risk assessment and unpredictability requirements | Add AU-C 240.17–.29 citations and explicit linkage |
| tbs-aud-078 | Partial-credit risk | Attorney letter responses not clearly distinguished between scope limitation vs inherent uncertainty | Explicitly anchor to AU-C 501.21–.25 |
| tbs-aud-015 | Judgment ambiguity | Deficiency #1 ($50k vs $200k materiality) could be argued as MW absent likelihood language | Add “reasonable possibility of material misstatement” qualifier |
| tbs-aud-037 | Clarity | SSARS compilation items correct but could benefit from citation | Add AR-C 80 references (optional but recommended) |
| tbs-aud-024 | Anchoring | Engagement acceptance decisions correct but not explicitly tied to QC/ET standards | Reference AU-C 210 and ET §1.220 |

---

## Part 2 – BAR (tbs-bar-053 through tbs-bar-032)

**Status:** Approved

### Notes
- Incremental analysis, variance analysis, process costing, spoilage, and sensitivity math verified step-by-step
- CAPM and risk-adjusted discount rate calculations correct
- PVIFA usage clearly instructed; approximation risk appropriately mitigated
- Difficulty alignment appropriate for CPA BAR TBS

**No revisions required.**

## Part 3 – FAR (tbs-far-040 through tbs-far-021)

**Status:** Needs revision

### Issues
| TBS ID | Issue Type | Description | Required Fix |
|------|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| tbs-far-040 | Anchoring | Subsequent event classifications correct but lack explicit “condition existed at BS date” test | Add ASC 855-10-25-1 and 25-3 language |
| tbs-far-014 | Clarity | Consolidation eliminations correct but downstream vs upstream not reinforced | Explicitly state downstream vs upstream treatment |
| tbs-far-070 | Partial-credit risk | Journal entry directions rely on implicit debit/credit logic | Clarify entry structure consistent with CPA UI |
| tbs-far-045 | Accuracy | ARO PV, accretion, and depreciation math verified | No change needed |
| tbs-far-021 | Clarity | Bond premium amortization setup correct but truncated rate disclosure resolved | No further issues |

---

## Part 4 – ISC / REG / TCP (tbs-isc-031 through tbs-tcp-032)

**Status:** Needs revision

### Issues
| TBS ID | Issue Type | Description | Required Fix |
|------|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| tbs-isc-049 | Partial-credit risk | Sampling sizes given without derivation rationale | Add AU-C 530-style explanation or rationale |
| tbs-reg-021 | Accuracy | Contingent fee exception must specify permitted only for refund claims and exams | Clarify Circular 230 §10.27 |
| tbs-reg-047 | Accuracy | Wash sale calculations verified; basis allocation correct | No change needed |
| tbs-reg-015 | Clarity | Capital gain netting rules correct but facts dense | Consider clarifying LT vs ST sequencing |
| tbs-tcp-075 | Anchoring | GILTI/Subpart F logic correct but lacks explicit IRC cites | Add §§951A, 954, 250 references |

---

## Part 5 – TCP (tbs-tcp-002 through tbs-tcp-028)

**Status:** Approved

### Notes
- Gift tax splitting and annual exclusion math verified
- Partnership liquidation basis mechanics correct (no gain recognition)
- QSBS §1202 exclusion correctly applied
- Research citations (IRC 351, §83(b)) appropriate for CPA research TBS

**No revisions required.**

---

## Final Assessment

- **Conceptual accuracy:** High
- **Exam readiness:** High after targeted revisions
- **Primary fixes needed:** Authoritative anchoring + reduction of partial-credit ambiguity

Once the noted revisions are made, **Batch 1 will meet AICPA-grade CPA TBS standards**.
