## TBS_SAMPLE_BATCH2_PART4 Review

**TBS Reviewed:** Yes  
**File Truncated:** No  
**Issues Found:** 1

### Errors
| TBS ID | Issue Type | Description | Suggested Fix |
|--------|------------|-------------|---------------|
| tbs-tcp-046 | Technical Accuracy | California residency safe harbor is misstated as 45 days. California’s statutory safe harbor for former residents is **546 consecutive days** outside CA (FTB rules). | Change explanation and option to reflect **546-day safe harbor**, or reframe question to avoid specifying a day count. |

### Quality Notes
- File is complete and not truncated; TBS range 46–60 is fully present.
- All other calculations verified step-by-step and are correct.
- REG gift, basis, installment, PAL, QOZ, IRMAA, and FTC mechanics align with current law (2024–2025).
- Distractors are plausible and exam-relevant.
- Difficulty alignment is appropriate for TBS format.

**Overall Assessment:** Approved with one required correction.
