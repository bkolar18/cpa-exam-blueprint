### CPA TBS CONTENT REVIEW – TBS_SAMPLE_FOR_REVIEW

**Review Framework Applied:**
- CPA-style partial credit assumed
- Strong authoritative anchoring required
- Exam UI constraints enforced
- TCJA provisions assumed active

---

## Simulation 1 – Subsequent Events Classification & Disclosure

**Overall Status:** needs-revision

### Technical Accuracy
- Recognition vs. nonrecognition distinction is conceptually correct.
- However, the simulation fails to **explicitly anchor decisions to ASC 855**.

### Issues Identified
- **Issue (accuracy / anchoring):**
  - Adjusting events are identified without citing that the underlying condition **existed at the balance sheet date**.
  - Nonadjusting events lack explicit linkage to events arising **after** the balance sheet date.
- **Issue (partial credit risk):**
  - Candidates could correctly classify events but lose credit due to ambiguous disclosure language.

### Required Authoritative Support
- ASC 855-10-25-1 (recognized subsequent events)
- ASC 855-10-25-3 (nonrecognized subsequent events)

### Suggestions
- Add a brief instruction reminding candidates to evaluate whether the condition existed at year-end.
- Clarify disclosure wording expectations to avoid UI rejection.

## Simulation 2 – Contingent Liability Recognition

**Overall Status:** needs-revision

### Technical Accuracy
- Probability assessment aligns with ASC 450.
- Measurement logic is incomplete.

### Issues Identified
- **Issue (accuracy):**
  - The simulation does not specify whether a **range of loss** exists or whether a **best estimate** is available.
  - This creates ambiguity under ASC 450-20-30-1.
- **Issue (exam UI):**
  - Journal entry format is not constrained to acceptable CPA exam account titles.

### Required Authoritative Support
- ASC 450-20-25-2 (probable and estimable)
- ASC 450-20-30-1 (measurement of loss contingencies)

### Suggestions
- Explicitly state whether the loss is a single estimate or a range.
- Constrain account selections to standard FAR exam terminology.

## Simulation 3 – Revenue Recognition Adjustment

**Overall Status:** approved with notes

### Technical Accuracy
- Correct application of ASC 606 performance obligation satisfaction.
- Revenue deferral calculation verified.

### Minor Issues
- **Issue (clarity):**
  - Explanation references “earned revenue” without tying to transfer of control.

### Required Authoritative Support
- ASC 606-10-25-23
- ASC 606-10-25-30

### Suggestion
- Replace vague language with explicit control-transfer wording.

## Simulation 4 – Income Tax Payable / Deferred Taxes

**Overall Status:** needs-revision

### Technical Accuracy
- Current tax payable computation is correct.
- Deferred tax logic is underdeveloped.

### Issues Identified
- **Issue (accuracy):**
  - Temporary differences are identified but not clearly labeled as taxable vs. deductible.
- **Issue (partial credit risk):**
  - Failure to reverse signs properly could cascade across multiple cells.

### Required Authoritative Support
- ASC 740-10-25-20
- ASC 740-10-30-5

### Suggestions
- Require candidates to classify each difference explicitly.
- Add sign guidance consistent with CPA exam UI.

---

## Simulation 5 – Journal Entry Construction

**Overall Status:** approved

### Technical Accuracy
- Entries are correct and exam-compliant.

### Strengths
- Clear debits/credits
- Acceptable account titles
- No cascading-error exposure

---

## Summary Assessment

- **Approved simulations:** 1 (with minor notes), 1 fully clean
- **Simulations requiring revision:** 3
- **Primary deficiencies:**
  - Insufficient ASC anchoring
  - Ambiguity creating partial-credit risk
  - Missing CPA UI constraints

Once revised per above, this TBS set will meet **high CPA exam–quality standards**.
