**Review Framework Applied:**
- CPA-style partial credit assumed
- Strong authoritative anchoring required
- Exam UI constraints enforced
- TCJA provisions assumed active

---

## Simulation 1 – Lease Classification and Initial Measurement (Lessee)

**Overall Status:** needs-revision

### Issues Identified
- **Accuracy:**
  - Correctly distinguishes operating vs. finance lease, but fails to explicitly require **balance sheet recognition for operating leases**.
- **Partial-Credit Risk:**
  - Lease liability present value computation does not specify payment timing (beginning vs. end of period).

### Authoritative Anchoring Required
- ASC 842-20-25-1
- ASC 842-20-30-1

### Suggested Fix
- Explicitly require recognition of both **ROU asset and lease liability**.
- State payment timing.

## Simulation 2 – Credit Loss Estimation (CECL)

**Overall Status:** needs-revision

### Issues Identified
- **Accuracy:**
  - Explanation improperly references a “probable” threshold.
- **Clarity:**
  - Estimation method (loss-rate vs. PD/LGD) not specified.

### Authoritative Anchoring Required
- ASC 326-20-30-1

### Suggested Fix
- Remove probability threshold language.
- Specify CECL estimation approach.

## Simulation 3 – Equity Method Investment

**Overall Status:** approved with notes

### Notes
- Dividends should be explicitly described as a **return of investment**, not income.

### Authoritative Anchoring
- ASC 323-10-35-4

---

## Simulation 4 – Subsequent Events vs. Contingencies

**Overall Status:** needs-revision

### Issues Identified
- **Accuracy:**
  - Blends ASC 855 and ASC 450 without requiring separate evaluations.
- **Exam UI:**
  - Disclosure language too vague for CPA scoring rubrics.

### Authoritative Anchoring Required
- ASC 855-10-25
- ASC 450-20-25

### Suggested Fix
- Force two-step analysis: subsequent event classification, then contingency assessment.
- Provide disclosure sentence structure.

---

## Simulation 5 – Deferred Income Taxes

**Overall Status:** approved

### Strengths
- Proper identification of temporary differences
- Correct deferred tax computation
- CPA UI–compliant sign usage

### Authoritative Anchoring
- ASC 740-10-25-20
- ASC 740-10-30-5

---

## Summary

- **Simulations reviewed:** 5 (all contained in file)
- **Approved:** 2
- **Needs revision:** 3

Primary issues are missing mandatory GAAP requirements, insufficient ASC anchoring, and ambiguity creating partial-credit risk.

Once revised per above, this file will meet CPA exam–ready TBS standards.
