### Errors
| Question ID | Issue Type | Description | Suggested Fix |
|-------------|------------|-------------|---------------|
| tcp-018-026 | Answer Accuracy | A U.S. person owning 15% of a *CFC* is generally required to file Form 5471 as a Category 5 filer once the corporation meets the CFC definition (>50% owned by U.S. shareholders). Marked answer implies filing may not be required, which is incorrect given the stem states it *is* a CFC. | Change correct answer to **"Yes—Category 5 filers must file Form 5471"** and revise explanation to distinguish Category 4 vs Category 5 clearly. |
| tcp-018-033 | Calculation Error | PFIC mark-to-market gain was computed using an incorrect basis. Basis given is $400,000, not $500,000. MTM gain should be $550,000 − $400,000 = $150,000 ordinary income. | Change correct answer to **A or revise option set** and correct explanation to reflect proper MTM basis mechanics. |

### Quality Notes
- All other answers verified and technically accurate under current U.S. international individual tax rules (IRC §§ 901, 911, 988, 1291–1296, 877A, 951–965).
- FEIE, FTC, FBAR, FATCA, treaty, expatriation, and CFC/GILTI concepts are current and exam-appropriate.
- Distractors are generally strong and reflect realistic CPA exam misconceptions.
- Explanations are clear and educational overall, with the two noted exceptions requiring correction.
- Difficulty alignment is appropriate; hard questions properly test advanced international tax planning concepts.

**Overall Assessment:** Needs revision due to one technical filing-rule error and one material calculation error.
