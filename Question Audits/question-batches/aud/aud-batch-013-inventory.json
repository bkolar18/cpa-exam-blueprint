      },
      "correctAnswer": "B",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "When inventory is counted at an interim date, the auditor must perform roll-forward procedures to ensure the inventory balance at year-end is accurate. This includes reviewing perpetual records and testing transactions in the intervening period.",
