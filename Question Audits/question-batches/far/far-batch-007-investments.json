    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Ownership over 50% indicates control, requiring consolidation, not the equity method. Indicators of significant influence (20-50% range) include board representation, policy participation, material intercompany transactions, interchange of managerial personnel, and technological dependency.",
