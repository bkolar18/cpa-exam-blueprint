    "explanation": "Under FIFO, perpetual and periodic systems yield identical results because the oldest costs are always assigned to COGS regardless of when the calculation is made.

    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Excluding markdowns from the denominator increases the retail total used to calculate the ratio, resulting in a lower cost-to-retail percentage.
