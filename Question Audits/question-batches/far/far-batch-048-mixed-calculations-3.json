      "question": "A company's year-end is December 31. On January 15 (before financial statement issuance), a major customer files bankruptcy; the receivable from this customer existed at year-end. What is the accounting treatment?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Type II - disclose only, no adjustment",
        "B": "Type I - adjust the financial statements",
        "C": "No recognition or disclosure required",
        "D": "Record as Year 2 transaction"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "This is a Type I (recognized) subsequent event because the bankruptcy provides evidence about conditions that existed at year-end (the customer's financial difficulty). The receivable should be adjusted (allowance increased) in the December 31 financial statements. Type I events require adjustment; Type II events require disclosure only.",
      "tip": "Type I (recognized): Evidence of conditions at balance sheet date - adjust F/S. Type II: New conditions - disclose only.",

      },
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The $30,000 gain was already recognized in OCI in prior periods. Upon sale: Net income includes $30,000 realized gain. OCI includes -$30,000 reclassification adjustment (removes from AOCI). Total comprehensive income impact in current period = $30,000 - $30,000 = $0. The economic gain was already recognized.",
      "tip": "Reclassification: When OCI item is realized, it moves to net income. Reclassification adjustment prevents double-counting in comprehensive income.",

      "question": "A company has receivables of $1,000,000. Based on historical loss rates and current conditions, expected credit losses over the life of the receivables are estimated at 3%. At adoption, AOCI has no related balance. What is the adjustment to retained earnings at CECL adoption?",

        "D": "Decrease of $22,500 (after 25% tax effect)"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "CECL allowance = $1,000,000 × 3% = $30,000. Adoption adjustment reduces retained earnings through cumulative catch-up. Pre-tax adjustment = $30,000 decrease. After-tax (assuming 25% rate) = $30,000 × (1 - 0.25) = $22,500 decrease to retained earnings. The DTA created offsets part of the charge.",
      "tip": "CECL adoption: Cumulative adjustment to retained earnings (net of tax). Creates DTA since allowance is not yet tax deductible.",
