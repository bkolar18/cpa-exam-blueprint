Only the portion in ending inventory is unrealized: $125,000 × 40% = $50,000. This entire $50,000 is eliminated against consolidated net income.

      "question": "Small Company (legal acquirer) issues shares to acquire Large Company, but Large Company's former shareholders end up with 70% of combined entity's voting shares. Who is the accounting acquirer?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Small Company (legal acquirer)",
        "B": "Large Company (accounting acquirer in reverse acquisition)",
        "C": "The combined entity",
        "D": "Neither; use pooling of interests"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "This is a reverse acquisition. Although Small Company is the legal acquirer (it issued the shares), Large Company is the accounting acquirer because its former shareholders obtained majority voting control. Financial statements are prepared as if Large Company acquired Small Company. Large Company's assets/liabilities carry over at book value; Small Company's are fair valued.",
      "tip": "Reverse acquisition: Legal acquirer issues shares, but target shareholders get majority control. Target is accounting acquirer. Assets of legal acquirer are fair valued.",
