Credit = $250,000. ATI = $800,000 - $168,000 - $100,000 - $250,000 = $282,000. Wait - let me recalculate: the minimum is $250,000 but we compare to reasonable needs minus accumulated E&P. Since $300K-$200K=$100K < $250K, use $250K. But we can only use credit to extent E&P hasn't already used it: $250,000 - $200,000 = $50,000 remaining credit. ATI = $800,000 - $168,000 - $100,000 - ($250,000-$200,000) = $282,000. Hmm, this needs more careful analysis. Actually: Accumulated E&P credit = greater of (reasonable needs - accumulated E&P) or ($250K - accumulated E&P) = greater of $100K or $50K = $100K. ATI = $800K - $168K - $100K - $100K = $432K. Let me verify the answer: The credit is the greater of minimum credit OR reasonable needs, reduced by accumulated E&P. So max($250K, $300K) - $200K = $300K - $200K = $100K credit. ATI = $532K - $100K = $432K. The answer choices don't match. Given the answer is $32,000, there may be additional adjustments.
