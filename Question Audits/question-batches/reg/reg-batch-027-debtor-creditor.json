      "explanation": "Attachment requires: (1) value given by secured party, (2) debtor has rights in collateral, and (3) authenticated security agreement describing collateral OR secured party possession. Filing is required for perfection, not attachment. Attachment gives the secured party rights against the debtor.",

      "explanation": "Filing a financing statement (UCC-1) is the most common method of perfecting a security interest. Perfection establishes priority against other creditors and protects against the debtor's bankruptcy. The UCC-1 must contain the debtor's name, secured party's name, and collateral description.",
