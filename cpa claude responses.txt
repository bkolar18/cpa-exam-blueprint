## Strategic Consulting Assessment (Response 1)

Great question. Here's my strategic assessment:

---

## Immediate High-Impact Additions

### 1. **Free Tools That Provide Real Value**
Students would return repeatedly for:

- **Score Release Countdown Timer** - Synced with AICPA score release dates, with email notifications
- **NTS Expiration Tracker** - Input your NTS date, get reminders before it expires
- **Study Hours Calculator** - "I have X weeks until my exam, how many hours/day do I need?"
- **Section Order Quiz** - More sophisticated than current form, with detailed reasoning

*These create habits and capture emails naturally.*

### 2. **Content That Builds Authority**
- **Exam Day Walkthrough** - Step-by-step of what to expect (parking, check-in, breaks, scratch paper)
- **Score Release Calendar** - Updated for current testing windows
- **State-by-State Requirements Guide** - Licensure requirements vary significantly
- **"I Failed, Now What?" Guide** - Compassionate, actionable content for retakers (huge underserved audience)

### 3. **Community & Social Proof**
- **Pass Stories** - Real candidates sharing their journey (video testimonials if possible)
- **Monthly Pass Rate Updates** - "47 students passed using our study plans this month"
- **Progress Tracker** - Let users log their study hours and see community stats

---

## Strategic Differentiators

### 1. **CPA Office Hours (Free Monthly Webinar)**
30-minute live Q&A with your CPAs. Topics like:
- "Ask a CPA Anything About FAR"
- "Busy Season Study Strategies"
- "Career Paths After Passing"

*Builds massive trust, captures emails, showcases expertise.*

### 2. **AI-Powered Study Assistant**
A simple chatbot that can:
- Answer common CPA exam questions
- Recommend section order based on situation
- Provide encouragement and motivation

*Could be built with the same stack as your Wedding Chat Tool.*

### 3. **Diagnostic Assessment**
A free 10-15 question quiz per section that:
- Identifies weak areas
- Provides personalized study recommendations
- Gates detailed results behind email capture

*This is what Becker and Roger charge for - offering it free is huge.*

## Lead Nurturing Improvements

### 1. **Email Sequence After Study Plan**
Currently we capture the email but don't nurture. Add:
- Day 1: Study plan delivery
- Day 3: "How to use your first week" tips
- Day 7: Section-specific content based on their recommended first section
- Day 14: Soft CTA for recommended program
- Day 30: "Checking in - how's studying going?"

### 2. **Segment by Intent**
Track which pages they visit:
- Visited /working-full-time → Send time management content
- Visited /sections/far → Send FAR-specific tips
- Visited /recommended-program multiple times → Higher intent, more direct CTA

---

## Technical Enhancements

| Feature | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Blog with SEO content | Organic traffic ("How long to study for FAR") |
| Exit-intent popup | Capture abandoning visitors |
| Progress saving | Let users save/return to their study plan |
| Mobile app (PWA) | Push notifications for score releases, study reminders |
| Referral program | "Share your study plan, get X" |

---

## What Would Set You Apart From Competitors

| Competitor Approach | Your Differentiation |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Comparison sites rank by commission | You recommend ONE program with transparent reasoning |
| Generic study tips | Personalized plans based on actual situation |
| Anonymous content | Named CPAs with real credentials |
| Paid tools | Free tools that actually help |
| Transactional relationship | Ongoing guidance through email nurture |

---

## Priority Recommendation

If I had to pick **three things** to build next:

1. **Email nurture sequence** - Maximize value from leads you're already capturing
2. **Score release calendar + countdown** - Evergreen traffic driver, highly shareable
3. **Free diagnostic quiz for one section (start with FAR)** - Major differentiator, high perceived value
