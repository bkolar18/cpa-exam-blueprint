CPA Exam Blueprint - Business Overview & Marketing Strategy
===========================================================

For: Surgent CPA Review Team
Prepared by: Project Development Team


THE PROBLEM WE'RE SOLVING
-------------------------

Right now, Surgent relies heavily on affiliate marketers and review sites to drive traffic.
That's fine, but here's the issue: those affiliates are often promoting whoever pays them
the most, and the leads come from people who are already comparison shopping. They're
halfway out the door before they even land on Surgent's site.

CPA Exam Blueprint takes a different approach. Instead of catching people at the end of
their decision process, we catch them at the beginning - when they're overwhelmed,
confused, and just trying to figure out where to start. We help them first, build trust,
and then introduce Surgent as our recommended solution. It's a warmer lead, and it's
coming from a place of genuine value rather than a banner ad.


WHAT THE SITE DOES (IN PLAIN ENGLISH)
-------------------------------------

Think of CPA Exam Blueprint as a free resource hub for CPA candidates. It's the kind of
site someone finds when they Google "how do I pass the CPA exam while working full time"
or "which CPA section should I take first." We answer those questions, give them tools
to plan their journey, and stay with them through the process.

Here's everything the site offers:


1. FREE PERSONALIZED STUDY PLAN GENERATOR

   This is the main lead capture tool. A prospective CPA candidate answers five questions:
   - Are they working full-time?
   - How many hours per week can they study?
   - What's their accounting background?
   - Which discipline section will they take (TCP, BAR, or ISC)?
   - Their email address

   Based on their answers, the site generates a customized study plan that includes:
   - Recommended section order (FAR, AUD, REG, plus their discipline)
   - Weekly study schedule based on their availability
   - Estimated timeline to pass all four sections
   - CPA-recommended tips tailored to their situation

   The plan is emailed to them, so we capture their contact info naturally. No hard sell,
   just genuine value. We now have a warm lead.


2. CPA ACADEMY (FREE USER DASHBOARD)

   Users can create a free account and get access to a personal dashboard where they track
   their entire CPA journey. It includes:

   - Study Session Logging: They can log study hours by section and date, add notes about
     what they covered, and see their weekly totals.

   - Progress Tracking: Mark each section as "Not Started," "Studying," "Scheduled,"
     or "Passed." Visual progress indicators show how far they've come.

   - Study Streaks: A gamification element that tracks consecutive days of studying.
     Shows current streak and longest streak. This keeps people coming back daily.

   - Achievements & Badges: Users earn badges for milestones like "First Study Session,"
     "Study Streak: 7 Days," "FAR Passed," etc. It's a small thing, but it creates
     emotional investment in the platform.

   - NTS Management: Track Notice to Schedule dates directly in the dashboard with
     expiration countdowns.

   Why this matters: Users who log into a dashboard regularly are FAR more likely to
   see our Surgent recommendation and take action on it. The dashboard has a tasteful
   promotional banner for Surgent that appears until dismissed.


3. PRACTICE QUESTIONS (600 QUESTIONS)

   We've built a substantial practice question bank with 100 questions per section:
   - FAR (Financial Accounting & Reporting)
   - AUD (Auditing & Attestation)
   - REG (Regulation)
   - TCP (Tax Compliance & Planning)
   - BAR (Business Analysis & Reporting)
   - ISC (Information Systems & Controls)

   Each question includes:
   - The question and four answer choices
   - Correct answer with detailed explanation
   - Difficulty level (easy, medium, hard)
   - Topic categorization
   - Helpful tips where applicable

   Users can practice by section, track their accuracy, and review their history. This
   keeps them engaged with the platform AND demonstrates that comprehensive prep
   (like Surgent's 8,800+ questions) would be even more beneficial.

6. SURGENT RECOMMENDATION PAGE

   This is where it all comes together. After users have received value from our free
   tools and content, we have a dedicated page explaining why we recommend Surgent.

   The page is TRANSPARENT - we clearly disclose that it's an affiliate relationship.
   This actually builds more trust than hiding it.

   We cover:
   - Why we recommend Surgent (A.S.A.P. technology, ReadySCORE, question bank size)
   - Honest pros and cons (yes, we list areas for improvement)
   - Pricing breakdown for all tiers
   - Comparison table vs. Becker and Roger
   - How Surgent supports our study methodology
   - Current promotions and discounts

   The page uses Surgent's brand colors and has clear CTAs to the Surgent website.


HOW THE MARKETING FUNNEL WORKS
------------------------------

Stage 1: Discovery
User finds us through organic search (SEO) when looking for CPA exam guidance.
Examples: "CPA study schedule," "which CPA section first," "CPA exam while working"

Stage 2: Value Delivery
User gets immediate value - a study plan, practice questions, tools, or content.
No paywalls. No hard sells. Just help.

Stage 3: Email Capture
User provides email for their study plan, NTS reminders, or score notifications.
We now have a warm lead who already trusts us.

Stage 4: Engagement
User creates an account, logs study sessions, earns badges, takes practice quizzes.
They return to the site regularly. They see the Surgent promo in their dashboard.

Stage 5: Soft Conversion
When they're ready to buy a review course (or after engaging with our content
enough), they check our recommendation page and click through to Surgent.

Stage 6: Follow-up
Users who signed up for NTS reminders, score notifications, or study plans are
in our email list. We can send helpful content and occasional Surgent mentions.


WHY THIS IS BETTER THAN TRADITIONAL AFFILIATES
----------------------------------------------

1. WARMER LEADS
   By the time someone clicks our Surgent link, they've already received significant
   value from us. They trust us. They're not comparison shopping - they're following
   a recommendation from someone who helped them.

2. EARLIER IN THE FUNNEL
   Affiliate sites catch people who are already shopping for a CPA course. We catch
   people who just learned they need to take the CPA exam. We're building the
   relationship from day one.

3. RECURRING ENGAGEMENT
   The dashboard, practice questions, and tools bring users back repeatedly. An
   affiliate banner is a one-time impression. Our platform is an ongoing relationship.

4. SEO COMPOUND EFFECT
   Every piece of content we publish (guides, blog posts, tool pages) is another
   opportunity to rank in Google. Over time, this compounds. Traditional affiliate
   sites have to keep paying for traffic.

5. BRAND ASSOCIATION
   When users associate their CPA journey success with CPA Exam Blueprint, and we
   recommend Surgent, that positive association transfers to Surgent.

6. DATA & INSIGHTS
   We're learning what CPA candidates struggle with, what they search for, what
   their timelines look like. This data is valuable for refining Surgent's
   marketing messages.

THE BOTTOM LINE
---------------

CPA Exam Blueprint isn't just another affiliate site slapping Surgent banners on
generic content. It's a genuine resource that helps CPA candidates succeed. We
happen to believe Surgent is the best tool for that success, and we recommend it
after proving our value first.

The result? Better leads, warmer conversions, and a sustainable marketing channel
that compounds over time instead of requiring constant ad spend.

It's affiliate marketing done right - value first, recommendation second.
