CPA EXAM BLUEPRINT - SESSION LOG
================================================================================

This file tracks what was accomplished in each session. Update after each
working session to maintain continuity.

IMPORTANT REMINDERS:
- This file is LOCAL - do not push to GitHub every update
- Log ALL console responses to "cpa claude responses.txt" (user cannot read console)
- Only push to GitHub when committing actual code changes

================================================================================
SESSION: 2026-01-11 (Auth Cookie Fix + TBS Tracking + Exit Session)
================================================================================

OBJECTIVES:
- Fix dark mode on 5 pages with colored sections
- Investigate and fix TBS API 401 Unauthorized errors
- Fix TBS progress tracking (Completed/Average Score not displaying)
- Fix notes not appearing in My Notes tab
- Add TBS Exit Session feature (save progress and resume later)

ACCOMPLISHED:

1. Dark Mode Fixes - 5 Pages
   - src/app/tools/study-hours-calculator/page.tsx
     * "How We Calculate Study Hours" section - added dark:bg-blue-950/40, dark:border-blue-800
   - src/app/tools/nts-tracker/page.tsx
     * "About Your Notice to Schedule" section - added dark:bg-green-950/40, dark:border-green-800
   - src/app/tools/score-release-calendar/page.tsx
     * Two colored sections - added dark:bg-blue-950/40 and dark:bg-green-950/40
   - src/app/guides/exam-day/page.tsx
     * Multiple colored boxes - added dark variants for blue, green, yellow, amber, red, purple
   - src/app/guides/failed-section/page.tsx
     * Multiple colored boxes - added dark variants for all colored backgrounds

2. Auth Cookie Fix (CRITICAL)
   - Problem: Client used localStorage auth (supabase-js), server expected cookies (ssr)
   - Fix: Changed src/lib/supabase/client.ts to use createBrowserClient from @supabase/ssr
   - Fix: Updated src/lib/supabase/middleware.ts to properly refresh sessions
   - Impact: Users must LOG OUT and LOG BACK IN to get new cookie-based session
   - This also fixes notes not appearing in My Notes tab

3. TBS Progress Tracking Fix
   - Problem: Stats/Attempts APIs used INNER JOIN with tbs_questions table
   - Issue: Frontend TBS IDs (like "far-i-1-1-je") don't exist in tbs_questions table
   - Fix: Removed JOINs from both API routes, query tbs_attempts directly
   - Fix: Use section column stored directly in tbs_attempts
   - Files: api/tbs/stats/route.ts, api/tbs/attempts/route.ts

4. TBS Exit Session Feature
   - Added exit confirmation modal to TBSContainer.tsx
   - "Save & Exit" - saves responses as incomplete attempt with time spent
   - "Exit Without Saving" - exits without database save
   - Progress summary shows questions answered and time spent
   - Uses Supabase upsert with onConflict: 'user_id,tbs_id'

5. Database Migration Required
   - User must run SQL migration in Supabase for TBS tracking to work
   - Migration adds section column, changes tbs_id from UUID to TEXT
   - Removes foreign key constraint on tbs_id
   - See SESSION_PROMPT.txt for full SQL script

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Files changed: 9
- Auth architecture: localStorage → cookie-based auth
- API fix: Removed tbs_questions JOINs from 2 routes
- New feature: TBS Exit Session modal with save functionality

COMMITS:
- b0a6249: Dark mode fixes on 5 pages
- 0b14343: Auth cookie fix (createBrowserClient)
- 41ee480: TBS progress tracking fix (removed JOINs)
- 131107d: TBS Exit Session feature

BLOCKERS/ISSUES:
- User must run SQL migration in Supabase SQL Editor
- User must log out and log back in after auth fix

NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES:
1. Verify TBS tracking works after migration + re-login
2. TBS Expansion: ~190 → 350 total TBS
3. MCQ medium difficulty expansion (49.2% → 55% target)
4. Phase 4: Email Nurturing
