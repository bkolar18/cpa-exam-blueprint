| far-nfp-adv-024 | Contribution vs exchange indicator | Options were dollar amounts | **FIXED** |
| far-nfp-adv-025 | Art/historical collection | Options were disclosure requirements | **FIXED** |

**Fix Summary:** 52 questions total had completely misaligned answer options replaced. Each question now has:
- Answer options that directly match the question topic
- Enhanced explanations with ASC/GASB citations
- "Why other answers are wrong:" distractor analysis
- Memory tips preserved

**Root Cause:** Unknown - possibly data import/export error or copy-paste issue during question creation.

## Quality Control Procedures

**Added:** January 14, 2026

Every question enhancement must include these QC checks:

### 1. Answer Option Alignment Check

**Verify:** All 4 answer options directly relate to what the question asks.

**Red Flags:**
- Options testing a different concept than the question stem
- Options that couldn't plausibly answer the question asked
- Distractors from a completely different topic area

**Example of Misalignment (BAD):**
```
Question: "What are the primary users of financial reports?"
Options: A) Relevance, B) Faithful representation, C) Comparability, D) Timeliness
(Options are qualitative characteristics, NOT user types!)
```

### 2. Topic/Subtopic/Concept Tagging Check

| Field | Requirement |
|-------|-------------|
| `topic` | Must match the main subject area (e.g., "Revenue Recognition", "Leases") |
| `subtopic` | Must narrow correctly (e.g., "ASC 606 Five-Step Model", "Lessee Accounting") |
| `conceptTested` | Must describe the specific concept being tested |

**Common Tagging Errors:**
- Topic too broad (e.g., "FAR" instead of "Inventory")
- Wrong category (e.g., lease question tagged as "Investments")
- Mismatched concept (e.g., conceptTested says "LIFO" but question tests FIFO)

### 3. Question Format Tagging Check

**Available `questionFormat` Values:**
| Format | Use When |
|--------|----------|
| `calculation` | Requires math/computation to solve |
| `conceptual` | Tests understanding of rules, definitions, principles |
| `scenario` | Case-based with context/story |
| `except` | "All of the following EXCEPT..." format |
| `definition` | Tests specific terminology |
| `best-answer` | "Which is MOST appropriate..." format |
| `application` | Apply a rule to a specific situation |

**DO NOT USE:** `MCQ` as a generic catch-all (this provides no useful information)

**`calculationRequired` Field:**
- Set to `true` if ANY math/computation is needed
- Set to `false` for pure conceptual/recall questions

**`timeEstimateSeconds` Field:**
| Question Type | Time Estimate |
|---------------|---------------|
| Calculation (multi-step) | 75-90 seconds |
| Calculation (simple) | 45-60 seconds |
| Conceptual/Definition | 30-45 seconds |
| Scenario-based | 60-75 seconds |

### 4. Difficulty Assessment Check

| Difficulty | Calculation Questions | Conceptual Questions |
|------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| `easy` | Single formula, values given directly | Definition recall, basic rule |
| `medium` | 2-3 steps, some setup required | Application, distinguishing similar concepts |
| `hard` | Multi-step, must derive intermediate values | Exceptions, edge cases, complex scenarios |

### 5. Accuracy Check

- [ ] Correct answer is actually correct
- [ ] Explanation matches the correct answer letter
- [ ] No duplicate question IDs in the file
- [ ] Question text is clear and unambiguous

## Question Format Tagging Status by Section

**Current State (January 14, 2026):**

| Section | calculation | conceptual | scenario | except | definition | application | MCQ (generic) | Status |
|---------|-------------|------------|----------|--------|------------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| FAR | 430 | 1,335 | 33 | 19 | 3 | 0 | 15 | ✅ Well-tagged |
| AUD | 2 | 383 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 630 | ⚠️ Needs retagging |
| REG | 9 | 131 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1,205 | ⚠️ Needs retagging |
| TCP | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 805 | ❌ All generic |
| BAR | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 490 | ❌ All generic |
| ISC | 0 | 70 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 505 | ⚠️ Needs retagging |

**Goal:** Eliminate generic "MCQ" tags; all questions should use specific format types.

## Where to Continue

### Next Questions to Enhance
Continue with other FAR topics:
- Search for questions without "Why other answers are wrong:" pattern
- Possible remaining areas:
  - Additional calculation questions
  - Any remaining EPS, Consolidations questions
  - Government Accounting advanced questions
  - IFRS comparison questions
  - Review/fundamental questions throughout file

### How to Find Next Batch
Run grep to find questions needing enhancement:
```bash
# Find PP&E questions
grep -n "far-ppe-" src/lib/data/practice-questions/far.ts

# Find questions with short explanations (likely need enhancement)
# Look for explanations without "Why other answers are wrong:"
```

---

## Enhancement Pattern

Each explanation should follow this structure:

### 1. Authoritative Reference
Start with "Per ASC ###..." or similar citation

### 2. Core Explanation
Explain why the correct answer is right

### 3. Distractor Analysis
```
Why other answers are wrong: (A) [explanation]; (B) [explanation]; (C) [explanation]; (D) [explanation]
```
Note: Only explain the 3 wrong answers, skip the correct one

### 4. Memory Tip
Concise, memorable tip (1-2 sentences max)

---

## Example Enhanced Explanation

**BEFORE:**
```
"explanation": "LIFO is permitted under US GAAP but is prohibited under IFRS (IAS 2).",
"tip": "LIFO: allowed under US GAAP, prohibited under IFRS."
```

**AFTER:**
```
"explanation": "Under US GAAP (ASC 330), LIFO is a permitted inventory cost flow assumption. Under IFRS (IAS 2), LIFO is explicitly prohibited. This is one of the most significant differences between US GAAP and IFRS for inventory. Companies with dual reporting requirements must convert LIFO inventory to FIFO or weighted average for IFRS statements. Why other answers are wrong: (B) LIFO IS permitted under US GAAP; (C) Reverses the rule—IFRS prohibits it, US GAAP permits it; (D) Neither framework requires LIFO; it's just an option under US GAAP.",
"tip": "LIFO: US GAAP = allowed, IFRS = prohibited. Major GAAP vs IFRS difference."
```
